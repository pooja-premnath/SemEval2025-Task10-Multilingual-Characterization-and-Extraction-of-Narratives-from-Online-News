After multiple instances of vandalism against famous landmarks and artistic works of western cultural significance, many people are growing annoyed with the actions of climate alarmists. One would think the goal of these groups would be to generate public sentiment for their cause; instead they have inspired the exact opposite. What they don't seem to understand is that not all attention is good attention.\n\nIn the past week climate activists targeted two very different venues to send their message of doom, disrupting the PGA Tour’s Travelers Championship in Cromwell, Connecticut and vandalizing the Stonehenge monument at Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire, England.\n\nTheir defacement of Stonehenge could be considered relatively successful because no one was able to stop them. It's impossible to understand the logic behind the focus on an ancient site created thousands of year before the development of carbon based energy. However, climate activists seem to be more concerned with media coverage than making sense.\n\nThe protester rush onto the PGA course in Connecticut, on the other hand, did not go so well for them. Throwing smoke bombs and running wildly across the 18th green, police quickly tackled them to the ground. The crowd cheered as the activists were subdued and chanted \"USA\" as they were dragged off the field. For those people that actually believe man-made climate change is a legitimate threat to the planet (it's not), this is the worst PR the movement could receive.\n\nThe most hated group in America (climate protestors) have STORMED THE GREEN at the 18th hole of the PGA Traveler’s tournament.— Chad Prather (@WatchChad) June 23, 2024\n\nSEND THEM TO JAIL…or bury them under the fairway.

Less than half of Americans believe climate change is caused by human activity. Younger adults ages 18 to 34 had the biggest decline in concern over climate change (a 17% drop), meaning the next generation is not as indoctrinated as many assume.\n\nClimate protests will likely increase in the next two months, with the normal heat of summer being exploited as a backdrop for global warming predictions that never seem to materialize.",

Mayor Garcetti Flies to Argentina to Fight Climate Change \n\n Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti joined a “global coalition of mayors” at a summit on climate change this week in Buenos Aires, Argentina, burning fossil fuels on an international flight rather than attending remotely and attending to pressing issues at home.\n\nIn a press release, Garcetti’s office said:\n\nMayor Eric Garcetti this week attended the C40 World Mayors Summit – joining mayors, climate experts, youth activists, and business leaders from around the world to advance global action to combat the climate crisis.\n\nThe C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group is an international network of nearly 100 of the world’s largest cities committed to concrete action to combat climate change. Mayor Garcetti served as Chair of C40 from 2019 to 2021, and was succeeded by London Mayor Sadiq Khan.\n\n“When it comes to fighting the climate crisis, our commitments as cities, states, and countries are only as strong as the size and ambition of our global coalition,” said Mayor Eric Garcetti. “The C40 World Mayors Summit is more than just another chance to recognize the magnitude of this make-or-break decade for climate action – it’s a chance to elevate the solutions cities are deploying at a neighborhood level that have a real impact on people’s daily lives. It’s also an opportunity to help national governments better understand the steps we can take together to chart a path toward a more livable and prosperous future.”\n\nGarcetti joined a U.S. Department of Transportation presentation on “high-quality urban transportation infrastructure,” though L.A.’s infrastructure is not widely considered “high-quality.” A proposed high-speed rail between L.A. and San Francisco has been largely canceled, and current passenger rail service from L.A. to San Diego has been suspended because of a potential landslide hazard.\n\nIn his opening address to the climate summit, according to the mayor’s office, he “laid out how Los Angeles is transitioning to clean energy sources and delivering on our climate justice commitments.” Garcetti’s “Green New Deal” calls for shuttering natural gas plants; it has been opposed by public works unions, and lost the only serious electoral challenge it faced in a 2019 city council race.\n\nWhite Garcetti was away, Los Angeles continued to struggle with the high crime and homelessness that have come to define his legacy, as well as a crisis in the City Council triggered by racist comments from City Council members within Garcetti’s party.\n\nAccording to the ICAO Carbon Emissions Calculator, Garcetti’s trip would have burned 1275.6 kg of carbon if he flew economy class, and twice as much if he flew business or “premium” class (assuming a stop in Atlanta). That is one-fourth (economy) or one-half (premium) the global average per capita use of carbon per year. It is not clear why the conference could not be held remotely.\n\nJoel B.

        "text": "Opinion: Restructuring Ukrainian debt is a step toward democratic victory \n\n Ukraine's victory is the victory of the entire free world over dictators and tyrants. The formula for victory is well known: the strength of the Ukrainian army, the unity of the free world, unwavering long-term military and financial support for Ukraine, and, first and foremost, Ukraine's membership in NATO. One element of victory is the restructuring of Ukraine's debt.\n\nAn agreement with holders of international bonds allowing Ukraine to suspend payments expires in August. However, no agreement on debt restructuring has been reached yet. Creditors must find a compromise given Ukraine's dire situation amid the devastation caused by Russia’s war. The Ukrainian government should study the experience of the 2015 debt restructuring effort.\n\nIn 2015, due to Russia’s initial invasion of Ukraine and the poor policies of then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, Ukraine was on the brink of default. Projected redemptions and debt servicing commitments amounted to an estimated $15 billion over four years. Ukraine’s war-torn economy, with its partially ruined industry, could not raise such funds.\n\nIn August 2015, my Government (for which I served as prime minister) reached an agreement with the Creditor Committee to restructure part of the $18 billion international debt (one-fifth of the total debt). This included a total write-off of $3.6 billion and restructuring $14.4 billion in debt payments over four years. All bondholders, except Russia, accepted this offer.\n\nThe restructuring was completed in November 2015 with a swap into new bonds and GDP warrants. In December 2015, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine approved a moratorium on paying off $3 billion of Russian debt. This was the first precedent of restructuring Ukraine’s external debt.\n\nIt was far from ideal, yet the estimated savings amounted to almost $9 billion, including the write-off of debt principal and interest and the moratorium on redemption to Russia. Forty-one million dollars was paid by GDP warrants. The total savings equaled $8.9 billion. Indirect savings in the form of deferred interest payments of $4.3 billion remained in the budget and supported the Ukrainian economy.\n\nThe current situation is much tougher. According to the World Bank, Ukraine’s war-incurred losses amount to $500 billion and grow daily. In 2022, defense funding needs resulted in a budget deficit of 18.6% of GDP in the first year of the full-scale war and 20.6% in the second year. This is five and five and a half times the level of the last pre-war year, respectively. Last year, slightly over 50% of state budget expenditures were funded by domestic revenues, and international financial assistance remains in high demand.\n\nThe war's toll on Ukraine’s public finances is extremely detrimental. The national debt has already exceeded 90% of GDP and continues to grow. Almost 70% of all international financial assistance to Ukraine comes as loans, with interest to be paid by the state. The public budget deficit is exacerbated by extensive national security and defense spending, reconstruction of socio-economic infrastructure, medical care services, payments to temporarily displaced persons, and other public commitments.\n\nIn these circumstances, Ukraine's economic survival becomes crucial and depends on resolving our national debt issue. The fewer public budget funds Ukraine needs to redeem and service its debt, the more it can invest in domestic weapons production and purchasing modern Western equipment. This enhances Ukraine’s ability to resist armed aggression, making it more likely for Ukraine to prevail and protect the civilized world from Russian military invasion. It reduces the risk of Russian missiles destroying children’s hospitals in Amsterdam or Warsaw and maternity hospitals in Berlin or Prague.\n\nIt is necessary to address the optimistic assessment of Ukraine’s external aid needs. According to the current International Monetary Fund-supported program (Q2, 2023 – Q1, 2027), Ukraine’s need for external financial assistance is estimated at $122 billion. However, over two years of the full-scale war, partners have already disbursed $100 billion annually. Therefore, the $122 billion figure over almost four years is misleading compared to Ukraine's real funding needs. At least $400 billion is needed to avoid loss. To prevail, this figure should be increased by half.\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte is attributed with saying, “A war requires three things. First, money. Second, money. Third, money.” The civilized world should financially weaken the aggressor through sanctions and the confiscation of frozen assets and continue assisting Ukraine. We need long-term financial assistance, export facilitation, and energy recovery. Restructuring Ukraine’s external debt is part of the financial toolkit needed to prevail in this war.\n\nIn late June, private creditors agreed to write off 37% of Ghana’s international bond value, despite Ghana not being at war. Some believe that since Ukraine receives large amounts of international aid, it can be used to settle with bondholders. However, over two-thirds of financial assistance arrives as loans to be redeemed. Importantly, international assistance funds are intended to support Ukraine, its economy, and its military to withstand the war.\n\nSome suggest rolling over bond repayments mentioned in this article for another two years. I categorically oppose this! There is no more space for interim decisions or further roll-overs. External public debt – bonds and GDP warrants – must be restructured in the form of a write-off. Ukraine should join NATO and the European Union. Ukraine must prevail in this war!\n\nMy Cabinet was the only one in Ukraine’s history to reduce state debt. As a Ukrainian bondholder of $500,000, I call on all private bondholders to accept the Government's proposal to restructure Ukraine's international debt. As a last resort, the compromise limit is a 50% debt write-off. I am ready to assume losses in a heartbeat. Writing off Ukrainian debt means assisting Ukraine in achieving victory, which is also a victory for democracy and a just world order. Democracy and a just world order are the pillars of global economic sustainability, ensuring investment safety and security and investor profits worldwide.",

Just 12% of Republicans and Republican leaners say dealing with climate change should be a top priority for the president and Congress.”\n\nBy contrast, 59 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say climate change should be a top priority for the president and Congress and an even larger majority (78 percent) views it as a major threat to the U.S., Pew found.\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.",

        "text": "Wild Kremlin TV hosts threaten the U.S. with nuclear strikes \n\n In the surreal world of Russian state television, Russia is about to prevail in its war against Ukraine, which is being presented as a battle against the United States and NATO. According to top Kremlin propagandists, it’s only a matter of time before the West admits its defeat and pays reparations to Moscow or risks a devastating nuclear strike.\n\nPundits who dared to criticize Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have not been seen on state-controlled television ever since they spoke out last week. Even though their timid disagreement pales in comparison to the bravery of Marina Ovsyannikova, an editor at Channel One, who has been detained after interrupting live programming with an anti-war sign. Meanwhile, state TV broadcasts are filled with cheerleaders, who repeatedly insist that the Kremlin’s “special operation”—known to the rest of the world as a brutal war—should not stop until all objectives are achieved. They insist that everything is going exactly as planned.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin’s willingness to negotiate with the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky is being packaged as a sign of his love and good will, and not the consequence of mounting losses and humiliating defeats faced by the Russian military in Ukraine. Appearing on a state TV show Sunday Evening With Vladimir Soloviev, political scientist and Professor of Communications Dmitry Evstafiev argued: “Right now, President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin’s third proposal to the Ukrainian leadership is on the table. This, of course, is a demonstration of his greatest respect and—I would even say—of love by our President towards the Ukrainian people.”\n\n\nMultiple state TV shows emphasized the reluctance on the part of the United States and NATO to intervene against Russia’s bloody invasion of its neighbor, presenting it as the proof that the Kremlin can go to any lengths to emerge victorious. Olga Skabeeva, the host of a state TV show 60 Minutes, intentionally distorted the statements of White House press secretary Jen Psaki. On Friday, Skabeeva claimed: “Jennifer Psaki’s statement said that no matter what Putin does in Ukraine—whether he uses biological weapons or drops a nuclear bomb—the United States won’t get involved.”\n\nOn Monday, disregarding strong bipartisan support of Ukraine in the United States, Skabeeva claimed that Americans don’t care about Ukraine and are concerned only with rising gas prices. She alleged: “To the dismay of the State Department, it turned out that Americans are indifferent towards saving Ukrainian Banderites.” Russian state media and government officials have taken to describing any opponents of the Kremlin in Ukraine as or “Banderites,” the followers of Stepan Bandera, the ultranationalist political figure who fought for Ukrainian independence before being assassinated by the KGB in 1959. This expression is being used as indiscriminately as branding all opponents the “Nazis.”\n\nThe show proceeded to broadcast a clip of former U.S. President Donald J. Trump, blaming Biden for his alleged inability to communicate with Putin. Hinting at the upcoming presidential elections, Skabeeva sniped: “Fun times for them are only starting. We’re waiting.” In the meantime, state media is replete with baseless promises of wide-ranging concessions from the West that Moscow anticipates receiving in the future.\n\nAppearing on Sunday Evening With Vladimir Soloviev, Russian parliament member Oleg Matveychev, known as the Kremlin’s spin doctor, watched a clip of Fox News’ Tucker Carlson—an everyday occurrence in Moscow’s tightly-controlled media environment. Matveychev noted: “There isn’t a single country in the world that is as easily manipulated as America.” He argued: “Here’s what will be on the table after our victory... After Ukraine’s demilitarization is completed... we’re going to raise the stakes... For example, the lifting of all sanctions... The dissolution of NATO, because the presence of NATO in some countries is getting in our way. Extradition of all war criminals... like [Anton] Herashchenko [former deputy minister at the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs], Zelensky, [former President of Ukraine Petro] Poroshenko. Extradition of various oligarchs, like [Mikhail] Khodorkovsky.”\n\nIn recent days, Russian state television regressed from Orwellian lies to Kafkaesque nightmares, as pundits started to promote the idea of executing Ukrainians resisting Putin’s war of aggression by hanging. They noted that the so-called “constitution” of the rogue “republics” created in Ukraine by Russian forces conveniently allows for the death penalty. Last Thursday on The Evening With Vladimir Soloviev, after listening to other pundits and experts endorse the idea of executing Ukrainian citizens by hanging, doctor of political sciences Elena G. Ponomareva argued: \"Never let morality prevent you from undertaking correct actions. I understand the importance of a humanitarian component... but morality shouldn't get in the way.\"\n\nSunday’s Vesti Nedeli hosted by Dmitry Kiselyov continued the theme of public hangings, broadcasting the scenes from the public execution of German Nazi soldiers on Kyiv’s Independence Square in 1946. The segment was entitled “Denazification of Ukraine—the new opportunities for growth” and appeared to serve as a tool to desensitize the Russian population for the grotesque war trials and executions the Kremlin is reportedly planning to conduct in Ukraine, perhaps in the same public square captured in the historical video.\n\nBloomberg previously reported that, according to an unnamed European intelligence official, Russia's intelligence agency, the Federal Security Service, has drafted plans for public executions in Ukraine after cities are captured. Russian state media appears to be laying the groundwork to normalize such an idea, in order to make it seem acceptable to average Russians.\n\nReciting the list of Russia’s future demands during Soloviev’s show, Matveychev became even more brazen: “We should be thinking about reparations from the damage that was caused by the sanctions and the war itself, because that too costs money and we should get it back. The return of all Russian properties, those of the Russian empire, the Soviet Union and current Russia, which has been seized in the United States, and so on.”\n\nThe host chimed in to ask: “Are you including Alaska and Fort Ross?”\n\nMatveychev nodded: “That was my next point. As well as the Antarctic... We discovered it, so it belongs to us... Also, the return of all medals that have been unlawfully taken from our sportsmen during all Olympic games, as well as the extradition of [Grigory] Rodchenkov, along with the extradition of multiple other criminals we’ll want. I think we should start voicing all of that, so they understand what will be on the table. You didn’t want to talk to us about something small, like Ukraine’s neutrality, here’s what you get. And that’s not even all of it.”\n\nSoloviev asked: “Does your list include a tactical nuclear strike, or are we going straight for the strategic one?”\n\nMatveychev pompously scoffed, “What for? We can take them down without it.”\n\nOn Monday, Soloviev revisited the topic of nuclear blackmail, perhaps blinded by rage after the recent seizure of his two Italian villas. He said: “I still think that those who took our money should be told, you have 24 hours to unfreeze our funds, or else we’ll send you what you know we’ve got. Your choice. Tactical or strategic, take a pick. You took our money, you’re the thieves, our talk is short with you: a bullet to the head.”",

What about a billion? We would lose our capacity for self-governance on this world. We have to act,\" he said.\n\nCheap and abundant oil and natural gas have to go, Gore says – for poor people, anyway – in order for the planet to stop warming. This is the goal of the Inflation Reduction Act, a Biden regime initiative that Gore says is \"primarily a climate act.\"\n\nThe legislation contains $369 billion, not including tax credits, in appropriation funds for \"renewable energy,\" meaning windmills, solar panels, and a very dark and cold future for humanity.\n\n\"Renewable energy ... is now the cheapest source of electricity in almost the entire planet,\" Gore lied.\n\nIn order to \"save the future,\" Gore concluded in his deranged speech, \"pro-climate legislation\" must be passed at all levels of government, and in all parts of the world.\n\n\"Rain bombs?

By subscribing you agree to our Terms of Use\n\nLatest Video\n\nNow, according to Schwab, the threat of climate change means people no longer have the right to wear laundered and clean clothes.\n\nCiting a new study, Schwab’s World Economic Forum (WEF) is urging governments to clamp down on people who wash their jeans and pants more than once per month, and their sweaters more than once per fortnight.\n\nAccording to the WEF, the global fashion industry is estimated to generate 92 million tonnes of textile waste each year, and the public must reduce amount by wearing dirty clothes instead of washing them after use.\n\n“Much of this waste could be prevented if we wore our clothes for longer,” said the WEF. “There is no way to make your clothes last forever, and their durability does to a degree depend on the quality of their fabric and how well they are made.”\n\n“One study found, for example, that with the correct care [wearing your jumper/sweater for fourteen days before washing it], you can double the lifespan of a jumper from seven years, on average, to almost 15.”\n\nIn an acute irony, globalist billionaires and neoliberal politicians routinely utilize private jets to fly into the organization’s yearly Davos conference, releasing more carbon into the environment than the average family does in a lifetime’s worth of laundry.\n\nThe World Economic Forum has consistently fought against plans that include rolling back perks and privileges for billionaires and elites, hoping to focus environmental policy exclusively on stripping away the fundamental rights of the citizens they consider to be beneath them.\n\nTRENDING: US Gov’t Building Secret Detention Facilities in 50 States for ‘Non-Compliant Dissidents’\n\nMeanwhile, Schwab has kicked off the Annual Meeting of the New Champions, aka “Summer Davos,” in Dalian, China.\n\nDuring the opening plenary, Schwab praised China for its economic policies while congratulating everyone participating in the event for representing “the most outstanding talents from business, government, academia, and civil society.”\n\nIn his brief opening statement, the unelected globalist founder of the WEF said that the participants must “foster collaboration” in order to drive economic growth and create a more resilient future.",

        "text": "There Are Only Downsides To Prolonging The War In Ukraine \n\n There Are Only Downsides To Prolonging The War In Ukraine\nAuthored by Connor O'Keefe via The Mises Institute,\nLast week, President Joe Biden and a number of top American and European officials met in Normandy to attend a ceremony marking the eightieth anniversary of the D-day invasion. In a pair of speeches, Biden recounted the operation that he said marked the beginning of the “great crusade to liberate Europe from tyranny” before drawing a direct connection to where things stand with the war in Ukraine.\n\nBiden called Russian president Vladamir Putin a tyrant who invaded Ukraine simply because he is “bent on domination.” Biden then renewed one of his favorite tropes, asserting that if Ukraine falls, its people will be subjugated, its neighbors will be in immediate danger, and all of Europe will be threatened by Putin’s aggressive ambitions.\n\nBut the West’s chosen depiction of Putin as a tyrant bent on conquering the entire European continent suffered its latest setback last month when it came out that the Russian president is interested in halting the fighting and negotiating a deal that recognizes the current battlefield lines.\nPutin is showing this interest even though the Russian military is in a strong position that seems likely to get even stronger. Last year’s long-anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive was meant to drive Russian forces out of Ukraine. But since its launch last summer, Ukraine has lost more territory than it has gained. Recently, the Russians even launched a brand new incursion into territory around the northeastern city of Kharkiv—territory that had already been recaptured by the Ukrainians in late 2022.\n\nRussia’s minefields, artillery, and punishing glide bombs have not only kept Ukrainian forces from advancing but left them struggling to hold their positions along the current front line. Meanwhile, Russia has significantly boosted war-related production far beyond anything we’re seeing from the West, which, while bad for the Russian economy in the long run, ensures the intensity of Russia’s bombing and shelling will not cease anytime soon.\n\nAt the same time, the Ukrainian government is facing a serious shortage of soldiers that no amount of foreign aid or equipment transfers can do anything to alleviate. Earlier this year, the Ukrainian parliament passed a law that sought to boost conscription rates by making it easier for the government to find and identify draft-eligible men. But the problem persists, leading Ukrainian officials to tap into the country’s prison population, cut consular services to military-aged Ukrainian men living abroad, and forbid men who are dual citizens from leaving Ukraine. As the country’s supply of young men runs low, the average age of a Ukrainian soldier has climbed to forty-three years old.\n\nWhat makes Ukraine’s situation even more tragic is how easily it could have been avoided. One month after Russia invaded in early 2022, both sides reached an agreement where Russia would pull back to preinvasion boundaries and, in return, Ukraine would agree to not seek NATO membership.\nThe deal could have put an end to the fighting and handed Kyiv control of all the land Russia had just seized. But, according to senior negotiators on both sides and high-level mediators from the various countries facilitating the talks, officials from the United Kingdom and the United States convinced the Ukrainians to walk away from the deal and fight.\n\nSince then, Ukraine’s leverage over Russia has only diminished. Many Ukrainians have been killed or maimed as the war has devolved into a brutal trench-style artillery war. Meanwhile, Russia laid permanent claim to the land it had earlier agreed to hand back to Ukraine.\nEven with its extensive conscription laws, Ukraine does not have enough soldiers to break through Russia’s now heavily fortified lines, much less to drive Russian forces out of all the territory claimed by Kyiv. The Ukrainians have, so far, been able to prevent the Russians from advancing and seizing all the territory that Moscow now claims. But with their dwindling numbers, Ukrainian forces won’t be able to hold these lines forever.\n\nSo, accepting Russia’s offer to move this conflict from the battlefield to the negotiation table is almost certainly the best chance Ukraine will get to hold onto the eastern territory they still control.\n\nBut rather than take this opportunity, the Ukrainian government and its backers in Europe and the United States have instead decided to escalate the conflict with risky, strategically pointless provocations.\n\nPresident Biden and a number of other European heads of state recently gave Ukraine a green light to use NATO weapons to conduct strikes within Russia. Around the same time, Ukraine struck two Russian strategic nuclear early-warning radars and attempted to strike a third one deeper in Russian territory.\n\nAnd, as if hampering Russia’s ability to confirm that they are not under a nuclear attack after allowing Ukraine to shoot US missiles into Russia wasn’t enough, the US then test-fired two nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles—launching them four thousand miles from California to the Marshall Islands.\n\nThe escalations have not been one-sided. Russia conducted drills simulating the use of strategic nuclear weapons in Belarus and has sent warships and a submarine to the Caribbean. The Russians have also stepped up shelling and airstrikes in Ukraine in response to the strikes on their territory.\nNone of this is necessary. The strikes on Russian territory have not translated to Ukrainian gains on the battlefield. And the Russian early-warning radar Ukraine hit wasn’t even aimed at Ukrainian airspace. All these escalations do is prolong the Ukrainian people’s suffering while nudging the world closer to a catastrophic nuclear accident.\n\nInstead of fantasizing about waging some World War II–level offensive on Putin’s Russia, Biden and his friends in NATO should come back to reality and, before it’s too late, agree to work this conflict out with words for a change.",

Her role was to warn, not to instruct: her most viral moments involved her scolding political leaders, not trying to supplant them. She strenuously avoided programmatic detail, saying such things were “nothing to do with me”. But now, on stage and in this book, she has found her political feet, specifically the Left-wing ideology of anti-capitalism and de-growth.\n\nInterspersed among the usual directives about the need to pressure political leaders, her message was more radical and more militant than it has been in the past. There is no “back to normal”, she told us. “Normal” was the “system” which gave us the climate crisis, a system of “colonialism, imperialism, oppression, genocide”, of “racist, oppressive extractionism”. Climate justice is part of all justice; you can’t have one without the others. We can’t trust the elites produced by this system to confront its flaws – that’s why she, much like Rishi Sunak, won’t be bothering with the COP meeting this year. COP itself is little more than a “scam” which facilitates “greenwashing, lying and cheating”. Only overthrow of “the whole capitalist system” will suffice.\n\nSo now we are finally seeing the contours of Thunbergism. Run your eye down the contributors to The Climate Book and you can see who she’s been reading: Jason Hickel, Kate Raworth, Naomi Klein. For these people the climate crisis isn’t man-made. It’s made by capitalism, as are the other forms of social injustice which plague society. There’s no GDP growth – especially of the capitalist sort – without increasing carbon emissions. The only solution to this state of emergency is for rich countries to immediately abandon economic expansion as a social goal.\n\nAs we have previously documented, the climate change agenda is merely radical leftism dressed up in a more palatable format.\n\nThe co-founder of Extinction Rebellion, the offshoot of which, Just Stop Oil, is currently engaged in blocking roads across London, admitted in his own words that his movement “isn’t about the climate.”\n\nIn 2019, Stuart Basden revealed the true goals of the far-left environmentalist action group in a lengthy article posted on Medium.\n\nBasden asserted that whatever climate problems exist can’t be fixed and that the movement should instead be focused on tearing down the entire system of western capitalism (China, the world’s biggest polluter, isn’t mentioned once).\n\nHe claimed that “European civilisation” is to blame for spreading “cruelty” and “violence” throughout the globe for the last 600 years and bringing “torture, genocide, carnage and suffering to the ends of the earth.”\n\nBasden then cited numerous “delusions” which are to blame for this situation, including “white supremacy,” “patriarchy” and “class hierarchy” (a strange one given that most Extinction Rebellion protesters are upper middle class snobs who do little but inconvenience and harm the working class).\n\n“The delusions of hetero-sexism/heteronormativity propagate the idea that heterosexuality is ‘normal’ and that other expressions of sexuality are deviant,” writes Basden.\n\nSo there you have it, it isn’t about the climate, it’s about bringing down the west and replacing everything it stands for with a nightmare far-left form of identity politics-mad totalitarianism.\n\nRELATED ARTICLES\n\n- EVs pollute 1850 times more than Fossil Fuel cars according to new study\n\n- UK Warns that China is Preparing for Total Nuclear War with the West\n\n- John Kerry Accuses Russia Of Polluting Too Much with their Ukraine War\n\n- Jacob Rothschild Dies At Age 87\n\n- UK Government-Funded Study Found Virtually No Dental Benefit From Fluoridation",

The research, led by Yang Song and colleagues, highlights the impact of elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) levels on this relationship, suggesting a closer relationship between vegetation growth and water availability than previously understood.\n\nThe very compound that the Democrats are targeting – CO2 – is actually the solution to preserving croplands, grasslands, forests and water supplies for growing populations.\n\nThe Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes, which encompass diverse ecosystems including croplands, grasslands and forests, are crucial due to their high human populations and significant terrestrial carbon sinks. The study analyzed data from 1982 to 2015, focusing on vegetation growth, measured by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and water availability, assessed through the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI).\n\nThe study found asynchronous trends. While vegetation growth has generally increased over the past three decades, water availability has shown more variable trends. This asynchronous behavior indicates a decoupling between vegetation growth and water availability in many areas. Despite the overall decoupling of this relationship, the study found that, in many regions in the Northern Hemisphere, this relationship has tightened.\n\nThis observation was most noted in croplands, grasslands and forests. Croplands and grasslands are increasingly constrained by water deficits. The study noted that both croplands and grasslands are experiencing stronger water limitations, which are becoming more pronounced over time. In contrast, forests are less constrained by water deficits and more affected by water surpluses. The relationship between vegetation growth and water resources in forested areas has weakened, suggesting that excess water rather than deficits is becoming a limiting factor.\n\nThe study identified atmospheric CO2 as a dominant driver of changes in relationship between vegetation growth and water resources. In fact, the CO2 levels influenced over 45% of grid cells. Elevated CO2 levels enhance vegetation growth through the so-called \"fertilization effect\" and improve water use efficiency. This indirect effect boosts water availability by reducing overall water consumption per unit of biomass.\n\nThe study also highlighted differences in how these changes occur across various ecosystems: On croplands, there was a consistent increase in the water deficit constraint on vegetation. On the grasslands, there were also increasing constraints, though at a slower rate compared to croplands. Forests saw a relative decrease in water surplus constraints, reflecting the ability of deep-rooted trees to manage water deficits more effectively.\n\nThe findings suggest that CO2-induced greening has further advantages in certain ecosystems, including changes in water dynamics that could influence the future risk of drought and the agricultural productivity of a given area.\n\nThe sequestration of carbon dioxide is a grave mistake that will slowly harm important ecosystems in the Northern Hemisphere. Of course, as wildfires and droughts increase, Democrats will continue to deride “climate change” as the greatest threat and continue to guilt the world into paying more to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. It’s a spiral of death and destruction, coming from a death cult pretending to be the planet’s savior.\n\nSources include:",

        "text": "How Green Fanaticism and the Sanctions Regime Destroyed the German Economy \n\n The German economy, the fourth-largest in the world, has ground to a standstill. There is no growth. Manufacturing is depressed, trade is weak, inflation is high, and jobs are scarce. Germany is now the sick man of Europe, and misguided energy policy is largely to blame.\n\nGermany has just recorded its third consecutive quarter of recession, marked by negative gross domestic product (GDP) growth. The central bank expects the rest of the year to be no better. Germany has recently experienced its highest rate of inflation in a quarter of a century. German inflation, among the highest in Europe, remained stubbornly high at 6.2 percent in July, compared with 5.3 percent for the eurozone as a whole. This despite the fact that German manufacturing is facing “its sharpest slump ... since May 2020”—that is, when the entire world was locked down.\n\nWhat President Donald Trump was referring to in 2018 was Germany’s increasing dependence on Russian gas, which in turn resulted from “green” energy policies implemented over the previous decade. These near-sighted and self-sabotaging policies effectively destroyed Germany’s highly efficient and inexpensive domestic energy production capacity derived from world-class coal and nuclear power. Before this decade of folly, Germany’s coal plants were among the most modern and efficient in the world. Low-carbon nuclear energy produced a substantial portion of Germany’s power needs. But all of this was forsaken in the quixotic pursuit of a utopian vision of zero-carbon green energy.\n\nImport of Russian gas thus became essential to the German economy. Germany imported more than 1.7 trillion cubic tons of gas from Russia in 2021, constituting nearly half of its total gas usage that year. As a result of the Russia–Ukraine war, the sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the United States and the West, and the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, Germany has been forced to find alternative sources of emergency fuel stock to keep its lights on and its citizens from freezing.\n\nAs a result, Germany’s electricity prices are now among the highest on the planet. The only countries paying more per kilowatt hour anywhere in the world are Denmark and Italy. Along with Germany, Italy’s energy supply was most affected by the disruption of Russian gas. Overall, those European nations that relied most heavily on Russian gas are paying more for electricity than other countries and suffering worse inflation as a result.\n\nFor background, coal had been essential to German energy and thus to the economy as a whole. But facing intense pressure from green politicians and evangelists of a looming climate apocalypse, Germany embarked on a plan to completely eliminate coal and other fossil fuels from its energy complex. This despite the fact that Germany’s consumption of coal was relatively minor as a portion of global totals—according to the International Energy Agency, China, India, and Southeast Asia consume three-quarters of global coal—and the coal was processed with much less of an effect on the environment.\n\nGermany reversed course on coal in 2022, as the geopolitical crisis forced “energy security to trump climate goals.”\n\nDecommissioned plants were reactivated, and plans to mothball others were postponed. Germany consumed more than 8 billion tons of coal in 2022, up by 19 percent from 2021. Despite the increase and because of the efficiency of German production, carbon emissions near the end of 2022 were nonetheless at their lowest level in 30 years.\n\nThe German government’s position is that this increased use of coal was “a last resort and short-term backup to secure energy supply” amid the emergency. Despite the stark reality on the ground, the nation’s leaders say they remain committed to eliminate coal by 2030 as part of their long-term objective to achieve “net-zero emissions.”\n\nVirtue-Signaling Straight Into the AbyssAccording to ClimateWatch, just three countries—China, India, and the United States—produce 42.6 percent of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. On the other hand, Germany produces 1.75 percent of global GHG emissions. A 25 percent reduction in Germany’s emissions—devastating to German GDP—would bring the proportion down to 1.3 percent of global GHG emissions.\n\nSo, in other words, Germany’s leaders have been willing to bankrupt its economy, impoverish its people, and plunge the nation into darkness for a rounding error. While German leadership virtue signals their way to perdition, China and other countries have been unapologetic in their intentions to increase GHG emissions as their economies grow.\n\nThe proposed solution of German leaders has been for its citizens to consume less and its factories to produce less or move manufacturing offshore. But why should the German people suffer for the idiocy of their leaders? Why should German industry be sacrificed to benefit other economies at the expense of their own?\n\nGermany’s beleaguered citizens appear to have had enough of this disaster. Political change is in the winds. The populist conservative party, Alternative for Germany, has just emerged as Germany’s second strongest party, polling at 20 percent support nationwide and more than one-third in some regions. One of the party’s main selling points is that it’s “an aggressive opponent of the government’s energy and climate policy.”\n\nPerhaps it isn’t too late for Germany after all.",

The more corruption and contract fraud comes to light, the less American taxpayers are willing to foot the bill, and their idolization of Zelensky begins to show cracks.\n\nPulitzer Prize-winning former New York Times journalist of Watergate fame, Seymour Hersh, is frequently accused of spreading Russian propaganda for thinly sourced claims related to the war in Ukraine. Earlier this year, it was his allegation that the U.S. was responsible for the undersea explosions targeting the Nord Stream II pipeline. More recently, it is because of his claims of corruption in the war zone. In this case, the Pentagon is also worried and investigations are being conducted, looking at contract fraud and war profiteering in Kyiv. On this, pretty much everyone agrees: Ukraine was highly corrupt long before its even more corrupted neighbor invaded. It’s a given that foreign aid is lining someone’s pockets. From this perspective, the shock and awe over the level of war-time corruption seems misplaced.\n\nBut there was something else Hersh mentioned in his subscription-generating blog. He cites an American intelligence source as saying that Ukraine is buying discounted Russian diesel to fuel its war and, as such, lining Putin’s pockets and also skimming from U.S. dollars intended to fund fuel purchases. This thinly sourced statement, however, skims over the complexities of a very nuanced war. It is not a statement that can exist without a deeper explanation–and that explanation takes the wind out of the sails of a very damaging allegation.\n\nIn 2022, Ukraine was purchasing tons of diesel from Bulgaria. That diesel was produced with Russian oil. In total, a journalistic investigation into these purchases showed that Bulgaria exported around $774 million in fuels (mostly red diesel) to Ukraine. That figure represented a 1,000-fold increase in such exports from before the Russian invasion. Bulgaria’s only gas oil refinery is owned by Russian Lukoil, and Bulgaria is fully entitled to continue to operate this refinery with Russian oil because it has an exemption from EU sanctions. So, yes, essentially, Ukraine was buying “discounted Russian diesel”, but in a very indirect way and not in the brazen way described by Hersh’s unnamed intelligence source. All of this market activity is accepted by the EU. Bulgaria is allowed to export products produced from Russian oil to Ukraine. In January, the U.S. started exporting fuel to Ukraine, reducing this dependency. That is the nuance that is ignored in brief statements that can easily be misinterpreted by the American public.\n\nDoes learning that this isn’t the Disney version of war and that the side the West is fighting for is simply the lesser corrupt among the two parties mean we should soften support for Ukraine’s war effort? Does learning that there may have been contract fraud along the chain from the U.S. to Ukraine mean we should withdraw and let Putin do as Putin will?\n\nAbsolutely not.\n\nThe American military aid to Ukraine is not about saving the Ukrainian people. There is nothing altruistic about it. It’s about the wider threat to Europe, and to NATO. It’s about the consequences of allowing the Kremlin to simply steamroll its way across Europe.",

        "text": "EU Central Banker Pushes Bitcoin Ban Under Guise of Climate Change \n\n Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum should be banned due to their “excessive ecological footprint”, a top European Central banker said this week.\n\nFabio Panetta, who serves on the Executive Board of the European Central Bank (ECB), called for the European Union to ban cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, that use proof-of-work validation for transactions, an energy-intensive but decentralised process that involves computers solving complex equations to compete for the ability to complete the transaction.\n\nThe Italian economist said that due to the European Union’s commitment to combatting climate change, those “crypto-assets deemed to have an excessive ecological footprint should be banned.”\n\nHowever, the environmental excuse appears to be a smokescreen for the real desired outcome by the ECB, namely the formation of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) and the elimination of non-government-controlled alternatives such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\n“Only central bank money can provide an anchor of stability. The solution is to extend today’s two-tier monetary system into the digital age. This system is built on the complementary roles of central bank money and commercial bank money,” Panetta said.\n\n“Central bank money is currently available for retail use in only physical form – cash. But the digitalisation of payments is eroding the role of cash and its ability to provide an effective monetary anchor.\n\n“Central bank digital currencies would instead preserve the use of public money for digital retail payments. By offering a digital, risk-free common denominator, a central bank digital currency would facilitate convertibility among different forms of private digital money. It would thus preserve the singleness of money and protect monetary sovereignty. The ECB is working on a digital euro precisely for these reasons.”\n\nEarlier this year, the European Commission said that it is planning on introducing legislation in early 2023 to create the framework for its own CBDC.\n\n“It would ensure that money continues to be denominated in euros. And It would be based on a European infrastructure, facilitating intermediaries to scale payments innovation throughout the euro area and thus strengthen Europe’s strategic autonomy,” ECB chief Christine Lagarde said last month.\n\nMeanwhile, in the UK, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has been a leading voice in supporting the implementation of a CBDC issued by the Bank of England, however, no timeline for its introduction has been announced as of yet.\n\nSunak, when he was serving under Boris Johnson as finance chief last year, claimed that a CBDC would function alongside psychical bank notes and coins, however, given the declining usage of cash overall, some fear that the CBDC would eventually replace cash outright.\n\nThe dangers of a Central Bank Digital Currency were laid out by the Bank of England itself, which admitted last year that they could be made “programable” so that the government could decide how citizens are able to spend their own money.\n\nTom Mutton of the Bank of England said: “You could introduce programmability – what happens if one of the participants in a transaction puts a restriction on [future use of the money]?\n\n“There could be some socially beneficial outcomes from that, preventing activity which is seen to be socially harmful in some way. But at the same time it could be a restriction on people’s freedoms.”",

        "text": "Former Commander-in-Chief of Ukrainian Armed Forces Zaluzhny is now the ambassador to the UK \n\n When Socialist Equality Party members and supporters lobbied the Ukrainian Embassy in London last Thursday, the intention was to deliver a letter demanding the release of our comrade Bogdan Syrotiuk to the ambassador.\n\nThe SBU secret service are attempting to frame Bogdan, a Trotskyist opponent of NATO’s proxy war, the Zelensky regime and of Russia’s invasion, as a supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nBefore reading out an Open Letter to the Ukrainian government, SEP National Secretary Chris Marsden explained that the new Ukrainian ambassador to the UK is Valery Zaluzhny, “who is the former head of the Ukrainian armed forces and is well aware of the crimes of the Ukrainian regime of which we speak.”\n\nAs with other embassies on this international day of protest, staff refused to take receipt of the letter, hiding inside locked gates in a clear demonstration of the nakedly criminal character of the Ukrainian regime and its frame-up of Bogdan.\n\nZaluzhny is a fitting representative, with blood on his hands. That he was appointed ambassador to the UK in March confirms the SEP’s insistence that a major escalation of NATO’s proxy war against Russia is being prepared.\n\nZaluzhny served as the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine from July 27, 2021 until February 8, 2024. He led Ukraine’s disastrous “counter-offensive” last year, which led to the deaths of at least 125,000 soldiers. Overall, the war has claimed the lives of at least 400,000 Ukrainian soldiers.\n\nZelensky removed Zaluzhny not as a result of the failure of the offensive, but because he was seen as a serious threat and was set to be his main rival in presidential elections originally scheduled for 2024. Zelensky cancelled the elections as tensions with the frontrunner Zaluzhny escalated last Autumn.\n\nThe WSWS noted of Zaluzhny, “Above all, he has established a close relationship with the country’s far-right. He has publicly expressed admiration for the Ukrainian fascist leader Stepan Bandera and has been photographed repeatedly with far-right paraphernalia.”\n\nDuring his time as commander of the armed forces, he appointed the leader of the fascist Right Sector organisation Dmytro Yarosh as his advisor. He has posed for photos standing proudly alongside other leading Right Sector members and in front of busts and portraits of the Ukrainian nationalist Nazi collaborators Stepan Bandera and Roman Shukhevych.\n\nZaluzhny was removed from his post on February 8, 2024 before taking up the position as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Ukraine to the United Kingdom on March 7. He now serves as a point man between the Ukrainian regime and its military and British imperialism, with the full support of his arch rival. Zelensky said of the appointment of Zaluzhny, “Our alliance with Britain must only grow stronger.”\n\nThat the UK was chosen as Zaluzhny’s destination after being deposed speaks to British imperialism’s leading role in the NATO-run war, as an anti-Russian provocateur, supplier of advanced weaponry and trainer of Ukrainian troops. His placement in the leafy splendour of Holland Park was seen as crucial to the effective prosecution of the war against Russia.\n\nThis has taken on additional significance as a result of the snap general election scheduled for July 4, with Sir Keir Starmer’s Labour Party most likely replacing the crisis-ridden Conservative government of Rishi Sunak. With Labour preparing to implement a major escalation of the war following a scheduled NATO conference on July 9-12, Zaluzhny can and must play a key role.\n\nHe not only has intimate knowledge of Ukraine’s military, but enjoys a close relationship with the UK’s chief of the armed forces Admiral Sir Tony Radakin.\n\nRadakin, along with other senior UK military figures, was intimately involved in every move made by Ukraine’s forces under Zaluzhny’s command.\n\nThe Guardian’s Defence and Security editor in Kyiv, Dan Sabbagh, reported on August 26, 2023: “Eleven days ago, some of the most senior members of the armed forces in the Nato alliance travelled to a secret location on the Polish-Ukrainian border to meet Ukraine’s chief military commander, Gen Valerii Zaluzhnyi [Zaluzhny], for what was privately billed as ‘a council of war’.\n\n“It was no ordinary discussion: Zaluzhnyi brought his entire command team with him on the roughly 300-mile journey from Kyiv. The aim of the five-hour meeting was to help reset Ukraine’s military strategy – top of the agenda was what to do about the halting progress of Ukraine’s counteroffensive, along with battle plans for the gruelling winter ahead plus longer-term strategy as the war inevitably grinds into 2024.”\n\nSabbagh reported, “Particularly notable was the presence not just of NATO’s military chief, the American Gen Christopher Cavoli, but also Adm Sir Tony Radakin, Britain’s most senior military officer, who is now acknowledged in Washington and Kyiv as an increasingly important actor in helping Ukraine overcome the Russian invaders.”\n\nAmid the crisis produced by the collapse of the counter-offensive, Radakin was chosen as the key figure to represent the imperialist powers under conditions in which it was considered politically unadvisable for the US to be openly involved. Sabagh reports, “That the Poland-Ukraine border meeting was not the first such conversation. The summit at the border had partly come about after Radakin travelled without any British ministers to Kyiv, where he held an unpublicised 45-minute meeting with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, aimed, defence sources said, at better understanding Ukraine’s strategy and how the west could help.\n\n“White House anxiety about the US appearing to be closely involved in the Ukraine war has meant that Radakin’s opposite number in the Pentagon, Gen Mark Milley, has been barred from travelling to Ukraine. But Britain, whose military is far smaller than the US, has no such concerns.”\n\nHe added, “A few days earlier, Zaluzhnyi had been urged by Milley, in a teleconference on 10 August where Radakin was also dialled in, to focus the counteroffensive on ‘one main front’, the New York Times reported.”\n\nSabagh’s briefing made clear the high esteem in which Radakin was held. “Oleksiy Danilov, secretary to the country’s national security council, said that Zaluzhnyi had told him after the meeting at the border ‘that’s our guy’.”\n\nThe appointment of Zaluzhny to London ensures that Britain remains a centre of intrigue to implement the most brutal and dangerous war policy since 1945 with no public discussion and no democratic mandate whatsoever.\n\nThe Socialist Equality Party is standing two candidates in the election, Tom Scripps in Holborn and St Pancras, and Darren Paxton in Inverness. The SEP election manifesto explains:\n\nThe SEP is using this election to break the conspiracy of silence maintained by the capitalist media, the major parties, the trade unions and what passes for the ‘left” over the acute dangers facing the working class…\n\nBuilding a new anti-war movement demands an irrevocable break with the Labour Party.",

The plan is to achieve 100 percent zero-carbon energy generation in the Golden State by the year 2045.\n\n\"The Democratic lawmakers themselves, along with a lot of Republicans even in red states, are just getting so much money from these companies,\" Ring says.\n\n\"There is a reason we have eminent domain for some purposes, such as building pipelines and streets. Now, we have an abuse of eminent domain, and also an overriding of zoning – the problem is when you use it for something that relies on hype, without a proven and compelling public interest.\"\n\nIllinois' 100 percent zero-carbon energy generation pipe dream is scheduled for five years later in 2050. To make that happen, Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker enacted House Bill 4412, which \"prevents counties from enacting preemptive local ordinances that outright ban local wind and solar projects, hindering the state's new climate goals.\"\n\nMichigan's 100 percent green energy generation target is scheduled for 2040, and Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is racing to get the job done with the help of House Bill 5120, which allows the Michigan Public Services Commission to decide where large green energy projects will be built – municipal governments no longer have a say in the matter.\n\nIn New York, the Office for Renewable Energy Siting (ORES) was passed in April 2020 while New Yorkers were stuck inside on COVID lockdown. That office has the power to not apply \"any local law or ordinance\" that is \"unreasonably burdensome\" for proposed green energy projects.\n\nGreen energy is a scam that benefits communist China and other foreign interests at the expense of American energy independence.

Six billion deaths are about as genocidal as it gets, so what is possessing these \"Just Stop Oil\" members to take the position they do when employing it would kill the vast majority of the planet? The answer, in part, is propaganda.\n\nAs the end of the biblical age of grace approaches, the world is increasingly coming unhinged, including environmentally as the birth pangs intensify. The theory that climate fanatics have adopted as to why this is all happening blames human activity and industry, even though the environment itself, i.e., volcanoes, is emitting far more \"greenhouse gases\" like carbon dioxide than the tailpipes on cars or the flatulence from cattle.\n\nEven so, member of groups like Just Stop Oil have been deluded – or perhaps deluded themselves – into believing that they must appease the climate gods by making all sorts of changes to the existing industrial world order. This, they believe, will stop things like \"global warming\" and the fear of \"boiling oceans\" destroying the planet.\n\n(Related: According to Sultan Al Jaber, the president of COP28, there is \"no science\" to back the \"green\" phase-out of earth-based \"fossil\" fuel use.)\n\nOn the very first day of an oil- and gas-free world as the members of Just Stop Oil envision it, all homes, businesses, and other structures that rely on either or both of these for light, heat, fuel, or what have you would no longer function.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, where gas stocks held above ground are typically not that high, gas distribution would cease to occur within 10 to 15 days due to a lack of pressure.\n\n\"This would mean in turn that the domestic supply would be shut down, too,\" one UK-based media outlet reported. \"... gas would stop flowing, and some 21 million households (74pc of the population) would no longer have heating, hot water, and cooking facilities.\"\n\n\"In their panic, people might turn to electricity for their cooking and heating, but wait ... The UK electricity grid relies on natural gas as its 'buffer' energy source. Every day, demand varies according to consumer demand, and the other main energy supplier, renewables, are highly variable and can only power the grid when gas is picking up the lion's share of the gap between their output and consumer demand.\"\n\nThis is just in the UK, mind you. Multiply these effects all around the world and you can see how quickly life as we currently know it would end almost instantly. Millions upon millions would die in the first few weeks, followed by billions more as the rest of the world and its oil- and gas-based systems collapse.\n\nUsing once again the UK as an example, the island nations that constitute it rely on a properly pressurized gas distribution system in order to keep the entire power grid, electricity and all, intact. If Just Stop Oil gets its way, the entire UK would lose the power and energy it needs to continue to exist, eventually leaving it destroyed and human-less. Do Just Stop Oil fanatics know this is what their pipe dream would actually entail once activated?\n\nDo you believe the planet is melting or boiling due to man-made climate change?

        "text": "US and NATO escalation of conflict with Russia is leading to war \n\n The US and its European allies, using Ukraine as a pretext, are deliberately and recklessly escalating their confrontation with Russia. Everything they are saying and doing leads to the conclusion that war, whether declared or undeclared, is their goal.\n\nAll the talk of imminent war is emanating from Washington, the European capitals and filthy pro-imperialist media on both sides of the Atlantic. The claims that Russia is about to invade are supplemented by dire warnings, for which absolutely no evidence is presented, that Moscow is planning to stage a “false-flag” operation, which it will then use to justify an invasion.\n\nIn the present circumstances, it is obvious that the claim is being trumpeted as a cover for precisely such an operation by Ukrainian special forces, trained by US military advisers working inside the country.\n\nAs it has in all the wars launched by the United States over the past three decades, the media is presenting unverified allegations and transparent lies as fact. Once again, the New York Times and Washington Post are leading the disinformation campaign, the purpose of which is to disorient and pollute public opinion.\n\nAs in 2003, when they promoted the lies about Saddam Hussein’s “aluminum tubes” and weapons of mass destruction, the Times and the Post are citing as “evidence” satellite and video imagery initially posted on social media outlets TikTok and Twitter by unknown individuals in Russia, which supposedly show the movement of military materiel out of the country’s Far East in a westerly direction.\n\nFurther “proof” of an imminent Russian invasion are meaningless images of 1) tire tracks allegedly created in the snow by the weight of military vehicles being loaded for transport near Lake Baikal; 2) “Iskander-M launch vehicles covered in tarp at an unspecified location;” and 3) a train allegedly parked near a station in Primorskiy Krai “fully loaded with what appears to be military vehicles.” All of this amounts to nothing.\n\nTurning reality on its head, the Washington Post declared in an editorial published yesterday (January 16): “This entire crisis has been manufactured by Mr. Putin.... It has nothing to do with expansion by NATO, whose founding treaty authorizes only defensive military action.”\n\nEven if it were true that Russia is about to invade Ukraine, how can it be claimed with a straight face that such a military action would have “nothing to do with expansion by NATO,” which has extended its boundaries 800 miles to the east since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991? How could Russia not be concerned by NATO’s obvious intention to bring Ukraine into its military alliance? And, if the issue of Ukraine is a mere pretext used by Putin to disguise his megalomania, why are the United States and NATO insisting that they will not rule out Ukraine’s future incorporation?\n\nAs for the Post’s pious assurance that NATO’s “founding treaty authorizes only defensive military action,” its editorial writers appear to have forgotten that NATO has been at the center of aggressive imperialist operations for the last 30 years. These include participation in the 1990–91 invasion of Iraq, intervention in Bosnia in 1992, the 1999 bombing of Serbia, the 2001 war against Afghanistan, the 2009 Operation Ocean Shield in Somalia, and the 2011 overthrow of the Libyan government.\n\nThe above list is only a partial record of the United States’ and NATO’s bloody violations of other countries’ national sovereignty. Nevertheless, the Post hypocritically declares: “Russia’s posture toward Ukraine amounts to prohibited conduct under Article 2 of the United Nations Charter, which specifically bars the ‘threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.’”\n\nThe United Nations Charter also prohibits Great Power interventions in the civil wars of sovereign countries and the overthrow of their governments, a stricture that American and European imperialism have ignored countess times over the past 75 years. In fact, the present government in Kiev is itself the product of a coup financed and organized by the United States and Germany.\n\nSpeaking with Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov on Sunday, CNN’s Fareed Zakaria highlighted recent tweets by former US Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul. The latter, who worked under the Obama administration, declared that if Putin wished to find a resolution to the present conflict he would have to listen to America’s “demands.”\n\nThese include, according to McFaul, the withdrawal of all Russian troops from the disputed territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, as well as, remarkably, Kaliningrad. The latter is internationally recognized as sovereign Russian territory. The US/NATO demand that it should decide where troops within Russia’s borders may be stationed means that Russia should accept the loss of its sovereignty. It is the type of demand imposed upon a conquered country.\n\nIn this context, the aggressive stance of Germany must be particularly jarring to Russia, which has not forgotten the 1941 invasion, which cost the Soviet Union approximately 30 million lives. Der Spiegel, Germany’s most widely circulated news magazine, declares in its latest issue: “NATO should finally deliver lethal weapons to Ukraine.”\n\nThis is not the language used when efforts are being made to de-escalate a crisis. The Washington Post goes so far as to imply that the possibility of a negotiated resolution of differences with Russia has been exhausted.\n\nIt writes: “With winter turning Ukraine’s flat terrain into a frozen-earth fast track for Russian tanks, the window of opportunity for a diplomatic solution is rapidly closing—if it were ever really open.”\n\nThe claim that the time for negotiations is coming to an end is a ploy used by those who are planning to launch a war, not by those who are seeking to avoid it.\n\nThe fact that more than 75 years after the conclusion of World War II the population of the former Soviet Union is once again confronting a catastrophe is the tragic consequence of the liquidation of the USSR 30 years ago, which was orchestrated by the Communist Party nomenklatura on the basis of the claim, now proven so tragically false, that imperialism was some sort of a myth and the reintegration of Russia into the world capitalist economy would usher in a new era of peace and security.\n\nRussia now faces a situation in which NATO troops and war machinery are stationed on its very borders and NATO regularly conducts massive military exercises all along its western flank.\n\nThe question that arises is why the United States, the principal instigator of the confrontation with Russia—and, it must be added, China—is pursuing an incredibly reckless policy that can lead only to disaster.\n\nThe answer can be found only within the context of the crisis of American and world imperialism. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the United States has repeatedly resorted to war to offset the longstanding decline in its global economic predominance. But all the military interventions have produced results that were the absolute opposite of what the United States intended. From Desert Storm through to the War on Terror, the record of its military operations has been a brutal, bloody and pathetic saga of disasters.\n\nBut the United States cannot “learn from its mistakes.” Thirty years after the first Bush administration proclaimed the “unipolar moment” and the start of a New American Century, the United States confronts a complex set of international and domestic economic, political and social contradictions for which it has absolutely no rational, let alone progressive solutions.\n\nThe entire economic system rests precariously on an unsustainable mountain of debt, which has grown exponentially over the past 14 years, particularly since the bailout of Wall Street in the wake of the 2008 crash.\n\nFueled by financial parasitism, social inequality has reached staggering levels. The dysfunctional political system is the product of rising and uncontrollable social tensions.\n\nThe pandemic, now entering its third year, has brought the tensions within American society to a breaking point.\n\nThe US media’s relentless pro-war propaganda is driven by the delusional belief that a major military conflict overseas will distract public attention from the massive domestic social, economic and political crisis. “Whom the gods would destroy they first make mad.”\n\nThe American crisis is, however, not unique. It is the epicenter of a global crisis of the entire capitalist system.",

        "text": "89% of ‘American Elites’ Back WEF’s Plan to Ration Meat, Gas, Electricity for General Public \n\n by Frank Bergman, Slay News:\n\nA disturbing new report has emerged revealing that an overwhelming number of so-called “American elites” support the tyrannical “climate” policies of the World Economic Forum (WEF).\n\nAccording to a report from the Committee to Unleash Prosperity (CUP), America’s wealthiest citizens fully support the WEF’s plan to ration gas, electricity, and meat and dairy products for the general public in order to allegedly “fight climate change.”\n\nThe report includes polling data regarding support for policies designed to force compliance with the WEF’s “Net Zero” agenda.\n\nAstonishingly, the polling shows that almost 90 percent of “American elites” believe strict rationing of gas, meat, and electricity is necessary to combat the so-called “climate crisis.”\n\nThe CUP report shows that 77 percent of higher-income Americans overall support these plans.\n\nHowever, 89 percent of those wealthy individuals from “top universities” believe in restrictions on the public’s quality of life to meet “Net Zero.”\n\nIn fact, nearly 60 percent of such people believe there’s too much liberty in America even though, objectively speaking, we’re less free than ever.\n\nMoreover, in another example of the pseudo-elite vs. street divide, 63 percent of Americans in general oppose the above rationing policy.\n\nReporting on the story, The College Fix writes that the “Committee to Unleash Prosperity [CUP], in a survey that sought to measure the beliefs of ‘elites,’ stated the findings reveal climate change ‘is clearly an obsession of the very rich and highly educated.’”\n\nThe poll, released this month and titled “Them vs. U.S.: The two Americas and how the nation’s elite is out of touch with average Americans,” was billed by the committee as a “first-of-its-kind look at the views of the American Elite.”\n\nThey are defined as “people having at least one post-graduate degree, earning at least $150,000 annually, and living in high-population density areas (more than 10,000 people per square mile in their zip code).”\n\nThe report is based on two surveys of 1,000 elites conducted last fall.\n\n“The study also examined a sub-sample of elites, adults who attended Ivy League schools or other elite private schools, including Northwestern, Duke, Stanford, and the University of Chicago” according to CUP.",

With an average of around 2,000 trees per hectare, “this gives an estimated total of 15.7 million trees which have been felled in order to facilitate windfarm development.”\n\n“Where woodland is removed in association with development, developers will generally be expected to provide compensatory planting in order to avoid a net loss of woodland.”\n\nGougeon claimed that many of the trees would have been “replanted on-site” and that the majority were expected to be cut down for commercial uses, regardless. Forestry and Land Scotland went on to claim that it has planted some 500 million trees during the same time period.\n\nHowever, responding to the letter, Mr Kerr said: “Most people will be astonished to see the number of trees cut down to make way for wind farms,” adding that the government “must be alive” to the “significant costs” of the installation of massive wind turbines.\n\n“I’ve been contacted many times by rural communities all over the country questioning the location of these developments, sharing legitimate concerns not just about the visual impact but also damage to wildlife and business. Now we learn there’s significant damage when it comes to trees.”\n\nIn addition to the need to cut down millions of trees, and the negative impacts on native bird and bat populations, wind turbines have also been criticised for their need for rare earth minerals in order to generate electricity. To create usable energy, high-powered magnets are made from rare earth minerals such as neodymium and dysprosium, which are almost exclusively mined in Communist China.\n\nThe mining process for such minerals can often have catastrophic consequences for local people, with villagers in the Chinese town of Dalahai previously recounting that their teeth began to fall out, they began suffering from skin and respiratory conditions, cancer rates shot up, and children were born with soft bones after a neodymium mine was opened up nearby.\n\nNevertheless, the Scottish government has vowed to continue its “green energy” push, with a Forestry and Land Scotland spokesman saying: “Renewable energy generated from wind farms is a key element in Scotland’s response to the climate emergency and the shift towards net zero and the infrastructure on land that we manage generates enough power for 600,000 homes.”\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.",

Well, just blame China. So while the West has been pouring massive military hardware into the conflict to the extent of emptying their own weapons warehouses – and still not winning – it’s Beijing that’s supposed to be the “decisive enabler” of the war. Seriously.\n\nNo wonder people say the West is losing its (dis-) information war over Ukraine, because few people outside Western capitals – more especially, their corridors of power and mainstream newsrooms – believe in all that nonsense.\n\nBut if the Western allies can’t win over there in eastern Europe, well, just drag it out and turn it into a war of attrition, then expand it to Asia. It’s just Ukrainian lives after all; Kyiv has been dragging men off the streets to be cannon fodder at the front lines.\n\nAmerica may be destroying trade globalisation. But make no mistake, it is globalising the war. That’s what people more conventionally call, starting a world war. A third one. All this lunacy was on full display in Washington last week, at the Nato’s celebration of death and destruction with its 75th anniversary summit. A defensive alliance long past its expiry date, Nato has been turned into an instrument of Western – or rather American – military expansionism.\n\nGiven his obvious mental decline, US President Joe Biden may be forgiven for claiming to ABC News’ host George Stephanopoulos that he was indispensable: “You know, not only am I campaigning, but I’m running the world.”\n\nNato and other Western leaders can’t claim dementia as an excuse, but they still entertain the delusion that they are running the world. And that’s the real existential danger – to all of us.\n\nAlarmingly, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has described Nato as playing a “bridge” between the Euro-Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific theatres.",

The others were promptly tackled and apprehended.\n\nOne of those who jumped in to protect the dancers, former Let’s Dance contestant Rickard Sjöberg, told Aftonbladet that he wished he had acted sooner, given that Kalla is currently pregnant.\n\n“I think that in this case it became dangerous because it happened in the middle of a dance where a heavily pregnant woman is participating. Then it becomes very important to do something, and I wish I had intervened earlier,” he said.\n\nThe three activists were then removed from the venue by law enforcement, and are currently facing potential vandalism charges.\n\nThe activist group Restore Wetlands claimed responsibility for the act, saying: “Are you also worried about the climate but find it difficult to understand why people need to disrupt a dance competition? The reason: The whole world is threatened by climate and societal collapse with devastating consequences.”",

The only ones you are helping are the shareholders of arms companies. Don’t expect the citizens of the EU to support you in this; you speak like crazed maniacs.”\n\nHer compatriot Mick Wallace agreed, expressing the opinion that European politicians “didn’t want peace; they wanted war.”\n\n“We wanted to support the American proxy war to damage Russia. We spent millions of taxpayers’ euros fueling a war that does not serve our interests, helping to destroy Ukraine,” he said.\nHowever, the most robust reaction from the assembly came in the statement from Slovak MEP Miroslav Radačovský.\n\n“We should stop supplying weapons to Ukraine, stop supporting the killing of Slavs. Because if we don’t stop, we, Slavs, will unite as brothers — and I believe we will unite — and level Western Europe to the ground. I’m sure no one here wants that,” the politician said.\nHe noted that the EU currently has no chance of winning against Russia and called the Ukrainian conflict a “US problem.”\n\n“We must start peace negotiations, but without Americans, and stop these killings,” he added.",

Gretchen Whitmer (D-MI) is ordering Michigan’s state fleet of vehicles to be 100 percent electric by 2040.\n\nIn a new directive Tuesday, Whitmer announced a move to bring the state’s fleet of vehicles down to zero greenhouse gas emissions in fewer than two decades. The goal, Whitmer wrote in the order, is “essential” for her administration’s green energy agenda.\n\nWhitmer wrote in the directive:\n\nMichigan is on the cutting-edge of mobility and electrification. Our world-leading auto industry is making the switch to electric, and we continue to attract battery, semiconductor, and clean energy investments from other states and nations. We must usher the future of mobility and clean energy into Michigan by winning projects and leading by example in state government. [Emphasis added]\n\n…\n\nToday I order the appropriate state agencies to begin the process of converting vehicles owned and used by the state—the state fleet—to zero emission vehicles [ZEV], with a goal of completing that conversion by 2033 for light-duty vehicles and 2040 for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles. This will reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, boost demand for Michigan automakers’ ZEV production, and reduce the overall costs of the state fleet. [Emphasis added]\n\nIn total, Michigan’s state fleet includes nearly 9,000 vehicles. The cost to state taxpayers to transition all of those to electric vehicles (EVs) by 2033 for light-duty vehicles and 2040 for medium and heavy-duty vehicles remains unknown.\n\nWhitmer’s directive comes as her administration has entangled the state of Michigan in investments featuring Chinese corporations with direct ties to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).\n\nGotion Inc., linked to the CCP, plans to build a $2.4 billion EV battery plant in the Big Rapids, Michigan, area at Whitmer’s behest.\n\nThe plant is so unpopular with locals that voters in the region recently ousted six elected Republicans who signed off on providing Gotion with taxpayer subsidies to build the plant in their backyard.\n\nSimilarly, Whitmer has worked with Ford Motor Co. to bring an EV battery plant to Michigan that would include involvement with Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. (CATL) — China’s premiere battery supplier with deep ties to the CCP. Most recently, Ford announced that it was already cutting job and investment projections for the project.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News. Email him at jbinder@breitbart.com.
