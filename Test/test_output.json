        "text": "“Sustainable Development Goals” are About Worldwide Depopulation Through Abortion \n\n With the present media fuss over \"climate change,\" people seem to have forgotten that there is no such thing as manmade climate change. As with extra-terrestrial aliens, it's a myth with no scientific backing. It was drummed up to provide globalists with an excuse to depopulate the planet. Repetition is the way of the communists and globalists. In speaking of their strategy, ex-communists have said that if you repeat over and over that a circle is a square people will eventually believe it. In parrot fashion, the globalist-controlled media has relentlessly harped on the issue of manmade climate change to the end that most people today have been brainwashed by it. Yet there is no truth to it.\n\nClimate Action is about Blaming Humanity. Climate action is all about blaming man for the ruin of the planet to justify eliminating him. Globalists are feverishly exploiting 1 the Canadian-Western U.S. fires to try to blame man for his \"sins\" against the environment. They allege that man's use of fossil fuels has brought on the fires, when in fact many of these fires are deliberately set to fuel climate action. Sustainability is about Abortion. The supposed goal of globalists is to sustain the planet through climate action. The key means of achieving this is through worldwide depopulation. Sustainability is all about abortion, i.e., it's an excuse to murder the unborn. Globalists would have us think that human babies are the no. 1 threat to the planet since they will grow up and pollute the environment with their \"CO2 emissions.\" These same globalists send their pawns into the field to ignite the fires, kill the fish, and pollute the waters so that they can have an excuse to cry climate action. It's all part of a one-world government-religion they are pushing, which turns it back on the Almighty and commands that we bow to the planetary idol of \"Mother-Earth.\" This in turn has enkindled the wrath of God that is becoming more and more evident with the ever-increasing floods, quakes, and elemental disturbances. What we are witnessing today is not global warming but Global Warning from On High, but in their blindness the scientists fail to see the writing on the wall.\n\nPlanned Famine. The present insanity over climate change has now penetrated into every facet of society like a cancerous fallout. For example, we hear about “sustainably caught tuna.” The fishing industry touts its “pole and line” fishing over the more effective method of using nets, alleging that nets pollute the ocean and harm whales and dolphins. Pampering the ocean with poles is ridiculous since fishing with nets does not harm the ocean. Christ's apostles used nets as did fishermen for the past 2000 years with zero damage rendered to the ocean. Environmentalists push this myth not only to promote sustainability but to start a famine and starve America. Not using nets results in less fish available in our stores. And it isn’t just the fish they are targeting, but they are deliberately destroying the crops, burning down storehouses, and killing millions of chickens and cows as part of their plan to ration our food and inflate the economy. Environmentalists can care less about the environment and wildlife, so people shouldn’t heed them. The various stories in the news about whales capsizing fishing boats suggest that “Karma” is getting back at us for harming the oceans and whales. Better that we forget the whales and save the babies to avoid the real punishment that is approaching from On High. The media obsession over climate action is telling. One media outlet will report that the western state fires have caused a smoke cloud to drift eastward, while another outlet says that the cloud is a huge CO2 emissions cloud produced by automobiles and factories. Lies!",

        "text": "Moscow To 'Mirror' West, NATO Approaches, Including Nuclear Weapons: Russia \n\n\nRussian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said on Friday that Moscow will \"mirror\" the West and NATO approaches, including on nuclear weapons issues.\n\nIn an interview with the Russian state news agency TASS, Ryabkov mocked the Washington administration, saying \"punks\" have come to power in the US, who are flagrantly violating Russia's red lines to show off.\n\nThe diplomat emphasized that Russia refrains from responding with full force and exercises \"exceptional restraint\" to avoid further escalation, acting strictly within the framework chalked out by the country's leadership and defined in terms of the goals and objectives of the \"special military operation.\"\n\n\"There are also these fashionistas in the Western group, alongside punks, who introduce ideas they deem fresh into discussions of what is going on,\" he said.\n\n\"For example, at the behest of Washington, the fashion of the spring-summer season of 2024 is the claim that Russian President Vladimir Putin would not stop in Ukraine but would definitely attack other NATO countries,\" he said, calling such claims \"completely absurd.\"\n\nRyabkov emphasized that such statements are more than just disinformation to distort the essence of Russian foreign policy.\n\n\"There is also another trend. This is the claim that strategic uncertainty and ambiguity should be shown concerning Russia so that Moscow does not know how NATO will act in a given situation.\n\n\"However, this uncertainty has always been characteristic of the doctrinal approaches of the Western group, including those related to nuclear weapons,\" the deputy foreign minister said, vowing, \"We will mirror them in this issue.\"\n\nWhen asked about the possibility of lowering the level of diplomatic ties, he said given the current crisis in relations, nothing can be ruled out, though it is not Russia's choice.\n\n\"Those in power in the US and other key Western states have recently gathered quite a lot of figures who are, by and large, provocateurs and have made the meaning of their existence a test of Moscow's strength,\" he said.\n\nRyabkov also responded to a question about US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to Ukraine by saying, \"Shortly before the departure of this group to Kyiv, we received the relevant information.\"\n\nRegarding the exchange of prisoners, he noted that the frequency of contacts on this issue depends on the American side, which focuses on high-profile cases followed by long pauses.\n\nIn response to allegations that Russia intends to interfere in the 2024 US Presidential election, Ryabkov said there has been no Russian interference in past elections and that there will be none, as Moscow fundamentally does not interfere in election campaigns in any country, with the US being no exception.\n\nAs for the November election outcome is concerned, he said, Moscow is monitoring the situation but sees no prospects for improving relations between the two countries, regardless of who wins, due to \"the fundamentally anti-Russian consensus among American elites.\" -",

Well, just blame China. So while the West has been pouring massive military hardware into the conflict to the extent of emptying their own weapons warehouses – and still not winning – it’s Beijing that’s supposed to be the “decisive enabler” of the war. Seriously.\n\nNo wonder people say the West is losing its (dis-) information war over Ukraine, because few people outside Western capitals – more especially, their corridors of power and mainstream newsrooms – believe in all that nonsense.\n\nBut if the Western allies can’t win over there in eastern Europe, well, just drag it out and turn it into a war of attrition, then expand it to Asia. It’s just Ukrainian lives after all; Kyiv has been dragging men off the streets to be cannon fodder at the front lines.\n\nAmerica may be destroying trade globalisation. But make no mistake, it is globalising the war. That’s what people more conventionally call, starting a world war. A third one. All this lunacy was on full display in Washington last week, at the Nato’s celebration of death and destruction with its 75th anniversary summit. A defensive alliance long past its expiry date, Nato has been turned into an instrument of Western – or rather American – military expansionism.\n\nGiven his obvious mental decline, US President Joe Biden may be forgiven for claiming to ABC News’ host George Stephanopoulos that he was indispensable: “You know, not only am I campaigning, but I’m running the world.”\n\nNato and other Western leaders can’t claim dementia as an excuse, but they still entertain the delusion that they are running the world.

        "text": "Understanding Ukrainian Nazism \n\nUnderstanding Ukrainian Nazism\n\nLucas Leiroz, researcher in Social Sciences at the Rural Federal University of Rio de Janeiro; geopolitical consultant.\n\nIn the West, media outlets are claiming that Russia’s agenda to “denazify” Ukraine is unfounded. At the same time, public opinion in Western countries is totally alienated from the Ukrainian reality, tending to believe only what is reported by the hegemonic media. The result of this is strong disapproval of the Russian attitude based on the lie that there is no trace of Nazism in contemporary Ukraine. In this sense, it is urgent that quality information be disseminated to the Western audience to avoid the proliferation of lies about the Ukrainian reality.\n\nOn almost every TV channel and newspaper in the West, Ukrainian Nazism is questioned with the worst possible arguments: Zelensky is Jewish, and the Ukrainian state is democratic. This kind of superficial thinking prevents a detailed analysis of the catastrophic situation in Kiev since the Maidan, when, through a coup d’état, an anti-Russian junta took power and institutionalized a racist and anti-Russian ideology, which remains until the current days.\n\nWhen we talk about “Ukrainian Nazism” we are not saying that Kiev is a contemporary copy of Hitler’s Berlin, but that the neo-Nazi element is a fundamental point of post-2014 Ukraine. The Maidan coup was openly supported and financed by NATO as a way of undermining any Russian influence in Moscow’s own strategic environment. The aim was to make Ukraine a puppet state, commanded from Washington, ending any link with Russia. There was not only the objective to annihilate political, economic, and diplomatic relations between Kiev and Moscow, but also to eliminate cultural, ethnic, religious, and linguistic ties between both nations.\n\nSince then, anti-Russian plans have been implemented. Ethnic Russians have been persecuted for the past eight years – even through systematic extermination in some regions. The Russian language has been criminalized in entire cities where the population does not speak Ukrainian. Schisms in the Orthodox Church have been supported to form a Ukrainian “national church” out of the Moscow Patriarchate. But the question remains: how has this been possible if Ukrainians and Russians are such close peoples? Many Ukrainians speak Russian and marry ethnic Russians, in addition to the fact that most of the country’s population follows the Orthodox Church. So how was it possible to initiate such a successful racist policy?\n\nThis was certainly one of the biggest concerns of the Maidan planners. And the answer lies in the Nazi element, which was very well worked out by Arsen Avakov, Minister of the Interior during the Poroshenko government. Avakov initiated a process of instrumentalizing neo-Nazi militias that had supported Maidan, making these extremist groups key points in the defense of the new Ukrainian regime. In the West, due to collective ignorance about Slavic history, many people think that Nazi racism was restricted to Jews, but in fact, anti-Russian hatred was one of the biggest locomotives of WWII, having led Hitler to the irrational decision to invade and try to annex the USSR. This sentiment is alive in these neo-Nazi militias, who are literally ready to do anything to annihilate the Russians, being much more fanatical in their racist convictions than the Ukrainian armed forces.\n\nGroups such as the Azov Battalion, C14 and the armed militias of rightist parties such as Pravyy sektor and Svoboda operate freely in Ukraine and are most responsible for the extermination of ethnic Russians in the Donbass. These groups act with more violence and using more sophisticated equipment than the Ukrainian armed forces themselves, being the real face of Kiev’s anti-Russian brutality. As neo-Nazis, these militias have no obstacles in complying with the government’s objective of destroying any ties between Russians and Ukrainians, thus being the main allies of the Maidan era.\nIn a 2020 Freedom House’s report, “A new Eurasian far right rising”, it is said that the far right is one of the strongest and most influential elements in Ukrainian society today, being a sophisticated, highly professionalized, and visible political force. In other words, what would be violent and criminal urban groups elsewhere on the planet have been converted by Kiev into a pro-Maidan parallel armed force. \n\nThe inspiration for this model of action comes from the original Nazism: the Schutzstaffel (SS) was one of the largest German armed political forces during the 1930s and 1940s, but the group was not part of the German Armed Forces, but a paramilitary militia instrumentalized by the government apart from the official troops. There was a major strategic objective with this: while the German military was commanded by the government, the SS fought for the Nazi Party and for Hitler – that is, if Germany surrendered, the SS would declare war on the German military. This type of “double-shielded” military system is the same one that Kiev has implemented: if one day a pro-Russian government is elected, the neo-Nazi militias will declare war on Kiev – and will be strong enough to defeat the official troops in the same way as the SS was stronger than the German armed forces.\n\nIt is necessary to note that these groups operate not only in the sphere of military force, but also in the cultural field, fomenting anti-Russian hatred among ordinary Ukrainians. The exaltation of Stepan Bandera (Ukrainian anti-Soviet nationalist leader who collaborated with Nazi Germany) is one of the symptoms of this. Before the Maidan, Bandera was a name like any other in Ukrainian history, but he came to be remembered and venerated as a national hero by neo-Nazis and anti-Russian politicians. In the same sense, these groups vandalize parishes and monasteries of the Russian Orthodox Church and are responsible for the consolidation of a Ukrainian mentality entirely hostile to Russia, which is gradually permeating the local population.\n\nUkraine is in fact ruled by a Jew and the country’s power structure is indeed publicly “democratic”, despite being internally authoritarian and corrupt. But the Nazi element is not in these aspects, but in the structure of protection of the post-Maidan Ukrainian state, which is supported by a national coalition of neo-Nazi militias whose objective is simply to persecute and kill Russians, regardless of who is in power in Kiev. It does not matter to these militias if the President of the Republic is a Jew – what matters is that Russians are dying, which favors both neo-Nazis and the pro-NATO politicians they protect. In other words, the Western media’s arguments to deny Putin’s claims about Ukrainian Nazism are weak and superficial.\nMoscow is right in its concern to denazify Ukraine. It is a measure that should be taken in coalition by several countries. All over the world, Nazism is “condemned”, but only when it benefits the West. The closest political experience to Nazism in the present days has been seen and peacefully tolerated by liberal governments that claim to be defenders of human rights and democracy. Russia is simply no longer willing to put up with crimes being committed by neo-Nazis against its people and there is nothing wrong with that decision.",

        "text": "NATO And Its Kiev Proxy in Last Roll of the Dice \n\nThe NATO NeoNazi regime in Kiev is going for broke, as its Third Reich forbears did during World War Two. This time around, though, the fascists have a nuclear terrorist card to play.\n\nAs in the endgame of World War Two, the Nazi Wehrmacht tried to break out in Kursk as a way to divert from battlefield losses elsewhere on the crumbling Eastern Front. The gamble proved futile then and looks like repeating disastrously today. The New Jerusalem: Zio... Best Price: $23.80 Buy New $13.00 (as of 09:07 UTC - Details)\n\nVladimir Zelensky, the illegitimate puppet president of Ukraine, is out of troops and money. His insufferable begging routine for more weapons and money has become played out. His country is set to default on eye-watering debts to international creditors. Russia’s military advances in the Donbass – formerly eastern Ukraine now part of the Russian Federation – have succeeded in pushing the Kiev regime to the brink of collapse despite the latter receiving hundreds of billions of dollars worth of NATO weaponry.\n\nZelensky, who is still clinging on to power nearly six months after he cancelled elections, senses the end is nigh for his corrupt regime and its war racket. With over 600,000 dead soldiers and remaining civilians hiding or fleeing in fear of conscription, the ex-comedian throws the dice with a few brigades despatched on a suicide cross-border raid on Russia’s Kursk region.\n\n“The Kursk maneuver could herald the end of Ukraine militarily,” remarked Gustav Gressel, a former Austrian defense ministry official, in an interview with Der Spiegel.\n\nGressel suggested that the Ukrainian brigades represent the final reserves for the NATO-backed Kiev regime. Once they are wiped out by the superior Russian forces then there will be nothing left for the Kiev side.\n\nThe BBC reported – with an air of glee – that convoys of troops are heading from Ukraine’s Sumy region across the border into Russia’s Kursk. The offensive has been going on for a week now, which Moscow says involves indiscriminate attacks on civilians and residential homes. The Kiev regime has said candidly that the objective is to “instill fear” among civilians. That’s a brazen admission of terrorism.\n\nIf Kiev’s other objective is to divert Russian forces from Donbass, that doesn’t seem to be working. Russian forces continue to make gains in the direction 0f Donbass – the main battlefield of this conflict.\n\nSo, what is the Zelensky junta playing at? It’s a terror tantrum to try to show his NATO sponsors that their proxy regime is still worth backing. The wasting of Ukrainian military lives is a desperate “working off loans for his masters”, as Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova put it.\n\nSending his people to die is Zelensky’s attempt to show his regime is still “liquid”. But it’s a final act of desperation. When this futile foray into Kursk is spent then it’s over.\n\nAs part of the final desperate act, the nuclear terrorism card is also being played – again.\n\nWhile the incursion in Kursk is going on, the Ukrainian side has tried to attack the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant and the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant. The ZNPP has come under constant shelling from the Armed Forces of Ukraine enabled with U.S.-made HIMARS missiles and other NATO weapons since Russia took over the civilian power plant – the largest in Europe – soon after the conflict erupted in February 2022. Russia took control at an earlier stage precisely because it anticipated that if it didn’t, the Kiev regime would use it as a false flag provocation regardless of the radiological contamination of Europe.\n\nIn the latest strike, one of the cooling towers at the ZNPP was set on fire. Russia says the tower was hit by a drone. Moscow denounced what it called “nuclear terrorism” and it called on the international community to sanction Ukraine.\n\nMoscow is wasting its breath. Numerous calls for condemnation over previous air strikes on the ZNPP by the Ukrainian side have been ignored or willfully covered up by the West.\n\nShamefully, the United Nations nuclear inspection body, the International Atomic Energy Agency, has also participated in the charade of pretending to not know who is attacking the ZNPP. Rafael Grossi, the IAEA director, acts like Manuel, the hapless waiter in Fawlty Towers: “I know nothing.”\n\nThe Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Zakharova nailed it with caustic irony, asking rhetorically: “Where is Rafael Grossi and the entire IAEA team?”\n\nShe added in a concise summary: “The terrorists in Kiev, under the leadership of the collective West, destroyed their country, ruined the people of Ukraine, undermined world energy and food security, and now they have taken up nuclear terror on the continent [of Europe]”.\n\nLaughably, the BBC and Guardian reported that Russia and Ukraine are “trading blame” for who is behind the attack on the ZNPP.\n\nThe British media outlets even quoted nonsense from Zelensky claiming that Russia had caused the fire (in a power plant it controls) by burning auto tires in one of the cooling towers. In comments belying projection, Zelensky said Russia was “blackmailing the world”. The Telomere Effect: A... Best Price: $3.01 Buy New $6.95 (as of 09:07 UTC - Details)\n\nThe Kiev regime has committed countless false-flag atrocities – from murdering its own people in the “Bucha massacre” to shelling children’s hospitals, theaters and apartment blocks. Nothing is beyond the depravity of this NeoNazi outfit. Attacking the nuclear plants in Kursk and Zaporozhye in a calculated gamble for inciting deeper NATO involvement is the hallmark of this regime.\n\nAs Gressel, the former Austrian military policymaker remarked, the Ukrainian regime is acting like “an unreliable daredevil”.\n\nIt’s going down and seems ready to take the rest of the world with it.\n\nHowever, ultimately, it is the United States and its NATO war machine that are responsible for the calamitous situation. The empire of lies created the terrorist Frankenstein monster solely for its reckless and criminal geopolitical ambitions against Russia to maintain its waning imperial power. The proxy war is lost in the worst debacle for Western imperialism possibly since the end of World War Two. Washington, the EU and NATO stand naked as spectacles of ignominy and disgrace. That presents an unprecedented precarious dilemma for the defeated U.S. hegemon where all sorts of insane acts can be expected.",

The German government only twice checked where the weapons it had sent abroad in 2023 ended up, Der Spiegel reported on Friday, citing officials. Meanwhile, Berlin's massive military assistance to Kiev was also left unsupervised, with German policymakers relying on assurances from Ukrainian officials. The Ministry of Economics provided the information in response to a request from Bundestag member Sevim Dagdelen, who is now a member of the recently formed BSW party founded by MP Sahra Wagenknecht. The latter, often described as the 'Icon of German Left,' has been a vocal critic of arms deliveries to Kiev. \n\nCiting the reply, Der Spiegel noted that Berlin had checked the whereabouts of small arms sent to Taiwan in January 2023, and in June, it carried out a similar inspection in Cape Verde. German officials insisted that both on-site inspections meant to make sure that the weapons did not leave the end destination went smoothly. However, regarding the massive commitment to finance the Ukrainian military, there have been \"no controls\" whatsoever, Der Spiegel reported, quoting the ministry. \n\nGerman officials reportedly stated that Kiev had assured them that all German weapons would remain in the country, adding that \"any verification measures must under no circumstances impair Ukraine's effective defense against ongoing Russian aggression.\" Ukraine received €17 billion ($18.7 billion) in military aid from Germany between January 2022 and October 2023, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. \n\nMeanwhile, the German government approved nearly €12 billion ($13 billion) in arms exports in 2023, setting a new record. Commenting on the officials' reply, Dagdelen called the inspections a \"laughing stock.\" She suggested that the German government was much more eager to check weapons going to Cape Verde than to Saudi Arabia - which she called a \"dictatorship\" - or the United Arab Emirates. \"Given the corruption in Ukraine, checks must be there too,\" the MP added. Russia, which has repeatedly condemned Western arms deliveries to Ukraine, has also warned that these weapons could end up in the black market, reaching criminals and terrorists around the world. \n\nMeanwhile, in late December, Ukrainian Interior Minister Igor Klimenko admitted that Kiev does not know precisely how many weapons are in the hands of its citizens. He noted that the estimates vary from one to two million and are based mainly on data provided by Ukraine's international partners and statistics collected in other conflict-ridden countries.",

This was a recommendation included in the sixth \"carbon budget\" paper, which sets out how the U.K. should reduce its emissions between 2033-37.\n\n\"There is significant potential to deliver emissions savings, just by changing the way we use our homes,\" the dossier also states. \"Where homes are sufficiently well insulated, it is possible to pre-heat ahead of peak times, enabling access to cheaper tariffs which reflect the reduced costs associated with running networks and producing power during off-peak times.\" The green quango also reported that by 2033 all newly built homes and up to half of those constructed after 1952 should be suitable for such pre-heating.\n\nCritics see how pointless this proposal is, especially since the \"climate alarmists\" have refused to open their eyes to elites using their most hated fossil fuel in their private jets and yachts. ZeroHedge's Tyler Durden even pointed out that CCC's Head Executive Chris Stark wants all ordinary citizens to turn off their electric heaters or heat pumps, which would mean a shift away from gas boilers, which Stark, a hypocrite, still has.\n\n\"I have a gas boiler. I wish I didn't, but I live in a flat, and heat pumps are a very difficult thing to put in there,\" Stark told the Commons environmental audit committee. \"The gas boiler guy who comes round and fixes my gas boiler – it breaks very often – tells me they will never work.\"\n\nWhat \"walk the talk?\" Stark seemed to imply.\n\nMeanwhile, the constant push of these globalists also ignores the fact that the power grid would not be able to take in the demand once the nation completely ditches the use of gas/fuel. Andrew Montford, the director of Net Zero Watch, told the Telegraph: \"The grid is already creaking, and daft ideas like this show just how much worse it will become. It's clear that renewables are a disaster in the making. We now need political leaders with the courage to admit it.\"\n\nMoreover, Tory MP Craig Mackinlay, head of his party's Net Zero Scrutiny group, said: \"It is becoming clear that adherence to judicable Carbon Budgets and edicts coming from the CCC are developing into farce. The Climate Change Act 2008 will require an amendment to free us from madcap and impractical targets foisted upon the population by long-departed politicians.\"\n\nMackinlay further criticized that the latest push to \"freeze people on cold evenings\" only shows the truth that the dream of plentiful and cheap renewable energy is a sham. \"I came into politics to improve all aspects of my constituents' lives, not make them colder and poorer,\" he told the news outlet. (Related: New York becomes first U.S. state to ban gas stoves, heaters in all new buildings – energy grid to suffer as a result.)\n\nThe CCC stood by its advice not to turn off heat pumps at night because \"homes will still be warm, but bills can be lowered.\" It claimed that the move would be a demonstration of homeowners benefiting from periods of the day when electricity is cheaper.\n\n\"Using electricity to heat a home opens the prospect of choosing a time when prices are lower, something that's not possible with a gas boiler,\" the CCC spokesman said, adding \"Smart heating of homes like this also makes the best possible use of the grid and supports greater use of cheap renewable generation.\"\n\nThe drive is in line with the United Kingdom government's plan to ban the installation of new oil-powered boilers from 2026, forcing all homes to adopt heat pumps. Downing Street has hinted it is now set to U-turn amid warnings the move would increase rural fuel poverty and put more strain on the struggling electricity grid. However, CCC still slammed No 10 over its \"worryingly slow\" action on climate in the latest report. The report included that the U.K. government's support for new oil and coal exploration and the expansion of airports meant Britain was no longer a global green leader, the Telegraph reported.",

        "text": "Companies With Good ESG Scores Pollute Just As Much As Those With Low Ones, New Analysis Finds \n\n As if there wasn’t exhaustive enough evidence that “ESG” is nothing but a scam, the Financial Times was out this week with a piece detailing how many companies with good ESG scores pollute just as much as their lower-rated rivals. Don’t say we didn’t warn you; we have been writing about the ESG con for years now, which along with other “sustainable” investments continues to see hundreds of billions of dollars in inflows from investors. \n\nThe FT added to our skepticism by revealing this week that Scientific Beta, an index provider and consultancy, found that companies rated highly on ESG metrics and even just the ‘Environmental’ variable alone often pollute just as much as other companies. Researchers look at ESG scores from Moody’s, MSCI and Refinitiv when performing the analysis. They found that when the ‘E’ component was singled out, it led to a “substantial deterioration in green performance”.\n\nFelix Goltz, research director at Scientific Beta told the Financial Times: “ESG ratings have little to no relation to carbon intensity, even when considering only the environmental pillar of these ratings. It doesn’t seem that people have actually looked at [the correlations]. They are surprisingly low.” He added: “The carbon intensity reduction of green [ie low carbon intensity] portfolios can be effectively cancelled out by adding ESG objectives.” “On average, social and governance scores more than completely reversed the carbon reduction objective,” he continued. “It can very well be that a high-emitting firm is very good at governance or employee satisfaction. There is no strong relationship between employee satisfaction or any of these things and carbon intensity.”\n\n“Even the environmental pillar is pretty unrelated to carbon emissions,” he said. RELATED: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Brags About Imposing Woke ESG System on Corporate America: ‘You Have to Force Behaviors’ Vice-president for ESG outreach and research at Moody’s, Keeran Beeharee, added: “[There is a] perception that ESG assessments do something that they do not. ESG assessments are an aggregate product, their nature is that they are looking at a range of material factors, so drawing a correlation to one factor is always going to be difficult.” “In 2015-16, post the SDGs [UN sustainable development goals] and COP21 [Paris Agreement], when people began to really focus on the issue of climate, they quickly realised that an ESG assessment is not going to be much use there and that they need the right tool for the right task. There are now more targeted tools available that look at just carbon intensity, for example,” he added. MSCI ESG Research told the Financial Times its ratings “are fundamentally designed to measure a company’s resilience to financially material environmental, societal and governance risks. They are not designed to measure a company’s impact on climate change.” Refinitiv told FT that “while very small, the correlation found in this study isn’t surprising, especially in developed markets, where many large organisations with focused sustainability strategies, underpinned by strong governance, higher awareness of their societal impact and robust disclosure will perform well based on ESG scores, in spite of the fact that many will also overweight on carbon”. Global director of sustainability research for Morningstar Hortense Bioy concluded: “Investors need to be aware of all the trade-offs. It is not simple. In this case, investors need to think carefully about which aspects of sustainability they would like to prioritize when building portfolios: carbon reduction or a high ESG rating.”",

        "text": "Putin: Russia has ‘sufficient stockpile’ of cluster bombs \n\n Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed in an interview published Sunday that Russia has a \"sufficient stockpile\" of cluster bombs and threatened to take \"reciprocal action\" if Ukraine used the munitions against his country. In the new interview, Putin made his first public comments in response to news that the United States delivered cluster munitions to Ukraine, which the Pentagon confirmed last Thursday. The interview is set to air Sunday night, but the reporter teased clips from it on social media in advance of the broadcast. Putin claimed his country has not used the weapon against Ukraine – despite strong evidence otherwise – but said Russia now \"reserves the right to take reciprocal action\" if Ukraine uses cluster bombs. \"Until now, we have not done this, we have not used it, and we have not had such a need,\" Putin added. The Associated Press and other organizations have documented the use of cluster munitions by Russian and Ukraine. The AP also noted that rounds of cluster munitions have been found at the site of Russian attacks.\n\nPutin's remarks come after President Biden said he made a \"difficult,\" but \"necessary,\" decision to supply Ukraine with the controversial weapon. Biden's decision met fierce opposition, including from a faction of his own party and from humanitarian activists, who argue the shipments of the controversial weapons were unjustified and would lead to civilian deaths. More than 100 countries have banned cluster bombs, although the United States, Ukraine and Russia have not. Cluster munitions are highly controversial weapons that open in the air and release smaller bombs, making them effective at targeting concentrated enemy troops. They can also pose a risk to nearby civilians, however, if the smaller bomblets do not go off right away. Ukraine has pledged only to use them away from civilians. U.S. officials have described the weapon as a potential \"game changer\" in Ukraine's counteroffensive attack against Russia's invasion. Artillery ammunition has been running low in the country.",

        "text": "Amnesty International refuses to apologize to Western leaders for report revealing human rights abuses by Ukrainian forces \n\nAmnesty International, the human rights organization globalists love to tout as the gold standard for such groups, is refusing to apologize to Western leaders for telling the truth about the fact that the Ukrainian military, like Russia’s troops, is also committing abuses. , investigators “found evidence of Ukrainian forces launching strikes from within populated residential areas, as well as basing themselves in civilian buildings in 19 towns and villages” in three war-torn parts of the country from April through July. The report also noted that the Ukrainian military utilized hospitals, schools and private residences in order to escape Russian forces though what the ‘human shield’ tactic really did was invite more casualties as Russian troops continued to attack Ukrainian forces wherever they could be found.\n\n“Such tactics violate international humanitarian law and endanger civilians, as they turn civilian objects into military targets. The ensuing Russian strikes in populated areas have killed civilians and destroyed civilian infrastructure,” the report said, adding that the results of this were Russian attacks on said civilian infrastructure, Zero Hedge reported, adding:\n\nThe report detailed further that in 22 of 29 schools visited by an Amnesty team between April and July, investigators found evidence of prior military activity. Additionally, five instances of Ukrainian troops using hospitals as bases were documented. The report went so far as to stress Amnesty was “not aware” of instances where Ukrainian troops first tried to evacuate civilians from these locations. “Not every Russian attack documented by Amnesty has followed this pattern. In certain locations in which Amnesty concluded that Russia had committed war crimes – including in some areas of the city of Kharkiv – Amnesty did not find evidence of Ukrainian forces located in civilian areas unlawfully targeted by the Russian military,” the report noted.\n\nThese truths have upset Western globalists. “This report by @amnesty International is such a disgrace. It only amplifies the narratives of the Russian #propaganda targeted against #Ukraine. With this one, AI has hit the bottom,” , Stanislaw Zaryn. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba was also very quick to rip the AI report : “I understand that Amnesty will respond to criticism by saying that they criticize both sides of the conflict. But such behavior on Amnesty’s part is not about looking for the truth and presenting it to the world, but about creating a false balance between the criminal and his victim.” Other commentators claimed that the organization was engaged in “victim-blaming” — which is true, to an extent, but also very accurate, given the findings listed in the report. “Amnesty International blames Ukrainian defenders for protecting civilians from attacks by Russian invaders. ‘Blame the victim’ false equivalency reflects the moral void at the heart of @amnesty. It’s a disgrace to people of conscience who value the protection of human rights,” Secretary General of Amnesty International Agnès Callamard said that her organization was under extreme pressure not to point any fingers at Kyiv, but she noted nevertheless: “Being in a defensive position does not exempt the Ukrainian military from respecting international humanitarian law.”",

        "text": "Zelensky Emerges as 'First Obstacle' to Peaceful Resolution of Ukrainian Conflict \n\n\nNext month, Switzerland is expected to host a conference ostensibly meant to help achieve a peaceful resolution of the Ukrainian conflict, even though Russia was not invited while BRICS members and Global South countries seem reluctant to attend the event.\n\nThe upcoming conference at the Burgenstock resort in Switzerland, touted by its organizers as an event to further the peace process\n\nin Ukraine, will most definitely be anything but a peace summit, says Swiss MP and former executive director of the Geneva Press Club Guy Mettan\n\n“The deliberate rejection of Russia is now jeopardizing the success of the meeting and returning against its organizers,” Mettan tells Sputnik, pointing out that Russia\n\nwas not invited to participate in the conference. “Aware of this problem, the Swiss official narrative is now trying to put forward that Russia didn’t wish to participate and that its absence came from its own decision, which is false and will not mislead anybody outside the collective West.”\n\nAccording to Mettan, the countries of the Global South\n\nmay end up sending their representatives to this gathering, though they will likely dispatch “medium-level participants with no-decision power, in order to avoid being accused of being ‘against the peace’ or of ‘boycotting the West’.”\n\n“For the Global South, the present questions are: why should it participate in a summit which is no longer a summit, which is not focused on peace due to the non-invitation of Russia, and which will certainly be a failure?” he adds.\n\nMettan also argues that Zelensky\n\nis in fact opposed to the “real negotiation process\" as he signed a decree banning any peace talks with Russia and with his so-called peace formula essentially calling for Russia’s capitulation.\n\n“He is the first obstacle to any peace negotiation. If he comes to Switzerland, it would be for receiving the support of his Western supporters and to get more aid for the war. Not for peace,” Mettan remarks.\n\nThe lawmaker suggests that Western support\n\nfor Zelensky's regime, aimed at weakening Russia, may persist until the US presidential election in November, but afterwards, the strategy's failures might become more apparent across the military, economic, financial, and political domains.\n\nMeanwhile, it appears that the summit in question has been snubbed by many of the prospective participants due to the “unrealistic approach” adopted by the event’s organizers, says Paolo Raffone, a strategic analyst and director of the CIPI Foundation in Brussels.\n\nDuring an interview with Sputnik, Raffone points out that not only Russia was not invited to the summit, but the conference itself is aimed at promoting the so-called Zelensky ‘peace formula,’ a scheme that includes the demand for Russia to cede a part of its territory to Ukraine as a precondition for ending the Ukrainian conflict\n\n.\n\n“Such an unrealistic approach is the reason for many invitees not attending. The countries that have chosen not to attend are aware that a dialogue in the absence of Russia does not represent ‘the legitimate interests of the parties’,” he explains. “Moreover, no peace talks are well funded if not based on reality. Any meaningful peace talks imply that the Ukrainian government must recognize the ‘new territorial realities’.”\n\n“World leaders are aware that any resolution to the war in Ukraine can only find a settlement between the real world powers underpinning the events, notably Russia and US,” he adds. “While behind the scenes contacts and talks are continuing, the majority of world leaders believe that the time is not yet ripe for ‘peace talks’ and that in any case the starting point cannot be other than the document drafted and mostly agreed in Turkiye in March 2022.”\n\nThe analyst also observed that the implementation of Zelensky’s plan would be impossible without the “direct military intervention of Western countries,” and that it has already become clear that “none of the Western countries will officially send troops\n\nto fight in Ukraine against Russia.”",

Zelensky’s Ukrainian money laundering scam might well outrank the \n\n and the South Sea Bubble as the greatest scam in recorded history. Before looking at Ukraine’s government warrants, which gives the game away to anyone with even a rudimentary financial or mathematical background, let’s just quickly survey Kiev’s empty coffers. In the East, Russian allied forces have secured most of Ukraine’s hard currency revenue generators. These apparently include financial boiler rooms, bio war labs and Hunter Biden linked factories to produce an array of opioids such as methadone as well as the ephedrine -type substances of t-phedrine and tri-phedrine which also saw action with NATO’s Syrian proxies. The net result of all that is because NATO will have to outsource such production to another compliant gangster state, to Bosnia, for example, it is money lost to Ukraine.  \n\nAlthough Russia should use all that booty, along with the Azov Nazis they have captured, to go after the bigger and more culpable fish, that is not our primary focus here. For not only has Russia captured an arsenal of smoking guns that should put the entire Biden and Pelosi families away for the rest of their natural lives but they have captured more fungible resources as well. \n\nSo far, Russian allied forces have secured at least $12.4 trillion worth of Ukraine’s energy deposits, metals and minerals. That figure includes over 63 percent of Ukraine’s coal deposits, 11 percent of its oil deposits, 20 percent of its natural gas deposits, 42 percent of its metals and 33 percent of its deposits of rare earth and other critical minerals including lithium. Because these resources are now permanently outside the clutches and scams of Zelensky’s domestic and foreign oligarchs, they can no longer be used as collateral in their ongoing frauds. Although Russia’s advances mean there is far less money in Zelensky’s kitty to pay off Zelensky’s creditors, Poland is an even bigger headache for the Kiev junta and America, lest we forget, has always insisted on getting its pound of flesh and more. \n\nPoland is doing to Zelensky’s Ukraine what Dutch multinationals and other predators did to Greece, to which we will shortly return. To fund Zelensky’s war, Polish companies are snapping up Ukrainian farms and produce with discounts of up to 80% and more. Though the Polish Investment and Trade Agency (PAIH) are providing production workshops in Poland for Zelensky loyalists to continue their businesses “in time of war”, the reality is that Polish companies are not only colonizing Western Ukraine but causing capital flight by allowing Ukrainian companies to set up shop in Poland with the same rights and lack of restrictions Poles have. \n\nUkrainians, given the choice of setting up in Poland or staying in cash strapped, missile prone Ukraine, are voting with their feet and moving en masse to the Polish motherland, whose entrepreneurs are buying up Galicia’s farms and other resources at knock down prices. Though it is the context of this Galician implosion that Zelensky’s promises to invade Crimea and to march on Moscow must be gauged, the fact that this jumped up naked dancer still commands any respect is certainly one for the history books. \n\nLet’s leave aside, for now, the fact that the Ukrainian Army is broken, that Western Europe is now over run by Ukrainian economic migrants with very dodgy political outlooks, that Zelensky cannot let a day go by without asking his NATO masters for another king’s ransom to blow up his nose and that of Hunter Biden and his other key advisors. Let’s instead look at Ukraine’s borrowing, at their GDP linked warrants in particular to see that Zelensky and his court are taking us all for the mother of all rides. \n\nEver since the Soviet Union’s collapse, Ukraine has been a basket case and Ukrainian bonds have been a byword in caveat emptor, in buyer beware, even more so that the revealing cases of Italy, Argentina, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Costa Rica and Greece, whose debt should have permanently debarred it from joining the euro system. Following the totally predictable collapse of the Greek economy and its subsequent rape by Dutch, German and French multinationals, Europe’s bankers hit on the brainwave of replicating the Argentinian solution of GDP linked warrants to milk even more blood from ravished Greece. Although the IMF very kindly explains the pricing mechanism for these exotic instruments here, the fundamentals are simple enough to follow, especially for those familiar with the basic Black Scholes and related European and American call option models. Briefly, a country, let’s say Greece, would produce a basket of commodities, let’s say yoghurt and cheese and, once the price of that basket rises above a certain amount, excess repayments would be made on what they owe, much like how a variable mortgage with options attached might work. Simplistic as that Greek example is, it highlights major problems not only for Greece but, more immediately, for Ukraine. \n\nIt assumes Greek cheese and yoghurt is in high and very constant demand and, like sugar, that it will vary in price, thus allowing excess payments to be made, and that foreign companies will not enter the Greek market to cannibalize it. None of those assumptions apply in Greece, which has been hammered within an inch of its national life by German, Dutch and French avarice. And none of them apply in Ukraine, which is being offered debt alleviation to keep the scam ongoing , something Argentina and Greece were never offered.",

These are far more destructive to the environment, require the extraction and importing of more raw materials for their construction and maintenance \"and cannot possibly deliver the amount of energy the nation – or the world – requires to prosper.\"\n\n\"The consequences of \"green\" policies are the primary reason why most Americans can no longer afford to own homes or pay rent, buy gasoline or pay their utility bills,\" wrote Ring. \"And these elevated prices for essentials factor into price increases for everything else. How will doing this make America strong enough to withstand a prolonged military conflict with peer adversaries?\"\n\nPerhaps the most devastating impact on Americans of these green energy policies is the fact that housing is becoming more and more unaffordable for Americans.\n\nBiden's Department of Energy has announced a $400 million program meant to go to state and local governments to incentivize them to implement new building codes that \"lower greenhouse gas emissions\" and fight the so-called \"climate crisis.\" (Related: Interest rate for 30-year fixed mortgage rises to 8.45% – the highest it has been since 2000.)\n\nMore than half of this endowment will go to implementing a universal \"energy conservation code\" that will compel homeowners to spend as much as $31,000 to renovate their homes to be in compliance with this directive.\n\nThe remainder of the fund will go toward implementing \"zero energy\" building codes, which will require residential buildings to install small-scale renewable energy generators \"to achieve zero-net carbon.\"\n\nThis additional spending for owners of houses and residential buildings comes at a period in the United States when families are already struggling to afford a home. The median home price in the U.S. already rose to its second-highest-ever price of $414,000 in July. Forcing developers to build new houses and apartments in such a way as to comply with green building codes.\n\nState and local governments that take advantage of the Biden administration's funding for implementing green building codes would further be spurred to eventually phase out the use of natural gas in homes and residential buildings – which could make energy costs even more expensive as cheap natural gas disappears.\n\nWatch this video of financial and economic expert Gregory Mannarino warning Americans to prepare for the biggest housing crash in the history of the world.\n\nThis video is from the High Hopes channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nIRONIC?

Who’d have thought it eh? \n\n 96% of U.S Climate Data Is Corrupted, Study Shows\n\nSOURCE: Slay News\n\nAmid the recent rise in fear-mongering reports from the corporate media driven by the globalist green agenda, many rarely look at the legitimacy of the data that these doom allegations of a so-called “climate crisis” are actually based on.\n\nMuch of the panic-inducing claims of a “climate emergency” we hear from in the media, often supported with scary red and fire orange-colored weather maps, are mostly based on corrupted data.\n\nHowever, the goal of the “climate crisis” narrative isn’t about “saving the planet” but rather ushering policies to comply with the radical “green agenda” goals of a handful of unelected globalist elites representing the interests of the World Economic Forum (WEF), the United Nations, World Health Organization (WHO), and other non-governmental organizations.\n\nTypically, meeting these “climate” goals involved stripping the public of their freedoms and rights to make the global masses easier to control by the few.\n\nIn recent weeks, the fear-mongering has been ramped up significantly.\n\nThe corporate media is awash with reports of heatwaves all around the world along with wildfires in Canada.\n\nDespite wildfires and heatwaves having existed on Earth long before humans did, we are now expected to believe that they are happening today because the climate has drastically changed over the past 100 years due to “man-made global warming.”\n\nJust last month, radical Democrat Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) was quick to blame the clouds of smoke wafting down from the Canadian wildfires on “climate change.”\n\nAs you likely expected without even needing to check, as AOC wouldn’t have, that claim turns out to be complete nonsense.\n\nBut the underlying facts that prove its nonsensical nature turn out to be well rooted in science.\n\nVeteran meteorologist Anthony Watts of the Heartland Institute has been studying the weather and the climate in general for a very long time.\nHe travels around the country inspecting meteorological equipment and studies historical weather data from around the world.\nWatts has been trying to warn the public that wildfires are common in many parts of North America, despite what the corporate media claims.\nThey’re just getting more attention from the press and on social media.\n\nAccording to Watts:\nRather than focusing discussion on what the real or imagined harms may be, how to mitigate them, and how to help people, climate activists are taking the opportunity to blame “climate change” for the smoke.\n\nThe reality is wildfires are becoming less frequent and severe as the planet modestly warms.\nAs wildfires become less frequent, it is nonsensical to blame the few wildfires that remain on climate change…\n\nPeer-reviewed studies and verified satellite observations show beyond a shadow of a doubt that wildfires in the long term, mid-term, and short term have become less frequent and less severe as the Earth modestly warms.\n\nThe likely reason is the measured increase in evaporation from the world’s oceans, which has resulted in more frequent global precipitation.\n\nThat’s not the most disturbing part of the story, however.\n\nWhen discussing the “modest warming” that the planet has exhibited, the claims must be backed up by solid data.\n\nBut as Dr. Watts has examined weather stations around the country, he has discovered that the available data may be nearly useless when attempting to quantify very slight changes in average temperatures.\n\nThe claims about warming are completely flawed because more than 90% of the data is “corrupted,” Watts warns.\n\nAnd the reason for that is the reality that the vast majority of thermometers that NOAA relies on are improperly installed and maintained.\n\nThis leads to the recording of artificially higher temperatures.\n\nWatts explains:\n\nA new study, Corrupted Climate Stations: The Official U.S. Surface Temperature Record Remains Fatally Flawed, finds approximately 96 percent of U.S. temperature stations used to measure climate change fail to meet what the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) considers to be “acceptable” and uncorrupted placement by its own published standards.\n\nThe report, published by The Heartland Institute, was compiled via satellite and in-person survey visits to NOAA weather stations that contribute to the “official” land temperature data in the United States.\n\nThe research shows that 96% of these stations are corrupted by localized effects of urbanization – producing heat-bias because of their close proximity to asphalt, machinery, and other heat-producing, heat-trapping, or heat-accentuating objects.\n\nIn order to produce accurate temperature readings based on NOAA’s own published standards, thermometers are supposed to be in natural, “pristine” locations such as fields, forests, or hilltops.\n\nHowever, Dr. Watts’ research has revealed that more than 90% of NOAA thermometers are in inappropriate places.\n\n96% are in parking lots, on buildings, against brick walls, or in other artificial environments.\n\nThe bricks, asphalt, and other human construction materials used in these environments artificially trap heat, leading to a “warming bias” in the collected data.\n\nThermometers placed in natural settings register lower average temperatures.\nThat’s not to say that the cities, parking lots, and highways aren’t warmer. They clearly are.\nBut it’s not because the planet overall is getting warmer.\nIt’s because we build things that trap and retain more heat than Mother Nature would capture and retain if left to her own devices.\n\nThese areas also have multiple man-made influences on temperatures such as vehicles, heaters and air conditioning units, subways, and more people, etc.\n\nSadly, these facts are ignored by corporate media reports on the so-called “climate crisis.”\nData showing that global temperatures are not increasing wouldn’t make any money for people like “climate czar” John Kerry and his private jet-setting friends, so you’ll never hear them endorse it.",

        "text": "Corruption In Ukraine Remains A Major Problem Published 24 mins ago \n\n War is a dirty business. The war profiteers descend on these battlefields like vultures. There are no exceptions. Ask Bosnians. Ask Iraqis. Ask Syrians. Take your pick. Everything is for sale on the battlefield.\n\nThat this type of war profiteering is happening in Ukraine should come as no surprise to anyone. By 1999 already, corrupt forces in Bosnia had plundered $1 billion in foreign aid money. Of course, that doesn’t compare to the magnitude of the corruption that went down in Iraq in the early 2000s. The Oil-for-Food scandal was corruption on a massive scale, and it was only one example.\n\nWar is a business, and the business of war is going on in Ukraine.\n\nThe over $62 billion in aid the Pentagon sent Ukraine in 2022 is a war profiteer’s dream, and there are varying voices in the U.S. government that have expressed concern about massive fraud and the potential for weapons and technology to end up in the wrong hands.\n\nThe even bigger concern is that the American public may soften its stance on defending Ukraine against Russia because of this. The more corruption and contract fraud comes to light, the less American taxpayers are willing to foot the bill, and their idolization of Zelensky begins to show cracks.\n\nPulitzer Prize-winning former New York Times journalist of Watergate fame, Seymour Hersh, is frequently accused of spreading Russian propaganda for thinly sourced claims related to the war in Ukraine. Earlier this year, it was his allegation that the U.S. was responsible for the undersea explosions targeting the Nord Stream II pipeline. More recently, it is because of his claims of corruption in the war zone. In this case, the Pentagon is also worried and investigations are being conducted, looking at contract fraud and war profiteering in Kyiv. On this, pretty much everyone agrees: Ukraine was highly corrupt long before its even more corrupted neighbor invaded. It’s a given that foreign aid is lining someone’s pockets. From this perspective, the shock and awe over the level of war-time corruption seems misplaced.\n\nBut there was something else Hersh mentioned in his subscription-generating blog. He cites an American intelligence source as saying that Ukraine is buying discounted Russian diesel to fuel its war and, as such, lining Putin’s pockets and also skimming from U.S. dollars intended to fund fuel purchases. This thinly sourced statement, however, skims over the complexities of a very nuanced war. It is not a statement that can exist without a deeper explanation–and that explanation takes the wind out of the sails of a very damaging allegation.\n\nIn 2022, Ukraine was purchasing tons of diesel from Bulgaria. That diesel was produced with Russian oil. In total, a journalistic investigation into these purchases showed that Bulgaria exported around $774 million in fuels (mostly red diesel) to Ukraine. That figure represented a 1,000-fold increase in such exports from before the Russian invasion. Bulgaria’s only gas oil refinery is owned by Russian Lukoil, and Bulgaria is fully entitled to continue to operate this refinery with Russian oil because it has an exemption from EU sanctions. So, yes, essentially, Ukraine was buying “discounted Russian diesel”, but in a very indirect way and not in the brazen way described by Hersh’s unnamed intelligence source. All of this market activity is accepted by the EU. Bulgaria is allowed to export products produced from Russian oil to Ukraine. In January, the U.S. started exporting fuel to Ukraine, reducing this dependency. That is the nuance that is ignored in brief statements that can easily be misinterpreted by the American public.\n\nDoes learning that this isn’t the Disney version of war and that the side the West is fighting for is simply the lesser corrupt among the two parties mean we should soften support for Ukraine’s war effort? Does learning that there may have been contract fraud along the chain from the U.S. to Ukraine mean we should withdraw and let Putin do as Putin will?\n\nAbsolutely not.\n\nThe American military aid to Ukraine is not about saving the Ukrainian people. There is nothing altruistic about it. It’s about the wider threat to Europe, and to NATO. It’s about the consequences of allowing the Kremlin to simply steamroll its way across Europe.",

        "text": "Servant of the Corrupt \n\n Zelensky didn’t have trouble incinerating vaunted democratic norms well-before Russia crossed the Rubicon into Ukraine this year. So it was no surprise when he did it again amid the war in late March, invoking emergency powers under martial law to nationalize TV channels and ban 11 opposition parties, including OPZZh all supposedly done in the name of combatting Russian misinformation and Russian sympathizers, even though OPZZh’s then-chairman, Yuriy Boyko, denounced the war and called for a ceasefire and the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine. Zelensky, however, wouldn’t miss another opportunity to clip the wings of political opposition in his country, certainly not now that Western media rationalizes and glorifies his every move. The portrait of the Ukraine president as a democratic paragon whitewashes the real Zelensky and conceals a vast web of corruption and international skullduggery of which Ukraine is situated in the center. Understanding the real Zelensky, requires seeing him as a creation of Ukrainian oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky. He is, in truth, a puppet of intrigue. The Pandora Papers.\n\nIt might be hard to believe now, but revelations from documents in the Pandora Papers millions of files from offshore service providers leaked to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and shared with partners around the world sent Zelensky reeling last year, threatening to end his political career. Though the actor-turned-politico campaigned as an anti-corruption reformer, the Pandora Papers showed him to be just as crooked as his predecessors. Of more than 300 politicians and public officials, including several current and former national leaders, in more than 91 countries and territories to whom the documents were linked, Ukraine was home to more secret offshore holdings than any other, including Russia. The Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), which contributed to the investigation, found that just before Zelensky was elected president, “he gifted his stake in a key offshore company, the British Virgin Islands-registered Maltex Multicapital Corp., to his business partner soon to be his top presidential aide. And in spite of giving up his shares, the documents show that an arrangement was soon made that would allow the offshore to keep paying dividends to a company that now belongs to his wife.”\n\nAs it was with crackdowns on free speech and political opposition, Zelensky’s office attempted to justify the use of offshores by blaming the specter of Russian aggression. An adviser to Zelensky’s chief of staff said the offshores were necessary to “protect” the group’s incomes against the “aggressive actions” of the “corrupt” regime of former President Viktor Yanukovych, who was ousted in a U.S.-backed color revolution in 2014. The expensive properties acquired by Zelensky associates in the center of London with the offshores, it seems, were but humble havens for persecuted Ukrainians. It was true that Zelensky and his partners in a television production company, Kvartal 95, set up a network of offshore firms dating back to at least 2012. That was also the year the company began producing regular content for TV stations owned by Kolomoisky, Ukraine’s most flamboyant oligarch and Zelensky’s key backer. The Raider.",

        "text": "Sean Penn’s Superpower: War propaganda \n\n American actor-director (and former anti-war activist) Sean Penn has been entirely swept up by the anti-Russian propaganda campaign of the US and NATO governments. He has become one of the most fervent and unhinged supporters of the fascist-infested Ukrainian regime of Volodymyr Zelensky. Penn is doing everything in his limited power to see that a third world war takes place.\n\nHis Superpower, ostensibly a documentary about the Ukraine-Russia war, will be available online September 18.\n\nIt premiered at this year’s Berlin film festival, where a screening was attended by Germany’s Culture Minister Claudia Roth (Green Party) and Oleksii Makeiev, Ukraine’s ambassador in Germany, along with Penn himself.\n\nAppropriately, Zelensky is credited as the “writer” of Superpower, a work of reactionary imperialist fiction.\n\nPenn’s film, which he co-directed with Aaron Kaufman, is unadulterated war propaganda. In between numerous scenes of the damage to life, limb and property inflicted on ordinary Ukrainian citizens resulting from Russia’s reactionary bombardment of the country’s cities and infrastructure, the film charts Penn’s visits to Ukraine and discussions, cigarette in hand and vodka or whiskey bottle not far away, with leading right-wing Ukrainian, Polish and US statesmen. The film lives up to Trotsky’s comment during World War I about “hacks of all political shades” putting out “as many lies as has been seen since the creation of the world.”\n\nA brief, potted résumé of Ukraine’s history in the past 10 years in the film leaves out the role played by the US and leading Western powers in systematically encircling Russia with military equipment and missiles. Film footage recalls the Washington-backed Maidan protests of 2014, but fails to make any mention of the role played by the US and NATO in the fomenting of “colour revolutions” in Eastern Europe. Instead, we hear members of the nationalist opposition in Kiev shouting the slogan popularised by the far-right, anti-Semite Stepan Bandera, “Glory to Ukraine! Glory to the heroes!” The slogans are later roared again in the film by young Ukrainian soldiers being drilled for intervention in the war.\n\nThe thinking and motives behind Superpower are clearly stated by its co-director Kaufman, who explained why he and Penn made the film: “We got really invested. And I think we got invested because we knew it was right, but also because we drilled into an idealism that felt genuine. Once you took it out of the context of the United States and you were no longer dealing with the right and the left—that whole paradigm—and you were looking at somebody else’s culture. ... I think that was enchanting to us.” [Emphasis added.] That is to say—leave out the role of the US and its bloody history of interventions in the Middle East, Central Asia, Latin America, Europe and throughout the world, and provide a version of events corresponding to the interests of far-right political forces—this is the bankrupt, mendacious ideology behind Penn and Kaufman’s film.\n\nEven an incomplete list of Penn’s US interviewees in the film is revealing. Penn takes advice from right-wing military and state department figures such as former Director for European Affairs for the US National Security Council (NSC), Alexander Vindman, and former US National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien, who both favour increased armaments for Ukraine to defeat Russia. Another of Penn’s talking heads is Congressman Eric Swalwell, Democrat from California, who seeks to up the foreign policy ante and declares that victory for Ukraine and the defeat of Russia is “the best deterrent against China invading Taiwan.”\n\nFor some of the Ukrainian participants, World War III is already underway. In his interview with Penn, Ukrainian central bank chief Andriy Pyshnyi, declares bluntly: “I think that World War III has already begun. And the front line is in Ukraine. War in Ukraine is just a start for the Russian Federation if it’s not stopped.” Taking up the same theme, Hollywood entertainment website Deadline concludes in its review of Superpower that the “documentary raises urgent questions, like whether we should acknowledge we have already entered World War III, and whether the Biden administration’s approach to supporting Ukraine—holding back advanced weaponry that could allow for a decisive victory—is prolonging the war and guaranteeing a stalemate that ultimately favors Russia.”\n\nIn another sequence in Superpower, we see Penn in discussion with a number of Ukrainian fighter pilots who argue that the country urgently needs advanced fighter jets with active radar missile systems. The film then cuts to a sequence in which the actor accompanies young Ukrainian recruits to a showing of the film Top Gun: Maverick in a cinema. This is followed by the news that Penn has arranged a video call with one of the film’s stars, Miles Teller, who in turn proclaims his admiration for the Ukrainian pilots. The message is clear and crude. America and the West must urgently send fighters to further escalate the war.\n\nThe point is reiterated by Zelensky at the end of Superpower. In the last of the three sycophantic interviews conducted by Penn, the Ukrainian leader complains he is unable to fly with only one wing. In order to fly properly, he implies, he needs Western fighter jets.\n\nPenn returned to the theme of more weaponry for Ukraine at a press conference for Superpower at the Berlin film festival earlier this year. Drawing from the foreign policy playbook of the German Greens, Penn ludicrously claimed that fresh weapon supplies fulfilled humanitarian aims: “It’s a very odd time when the most significant humanitarian response that can happen right now is the delivery and supply of long-range precision missiles to a country under invasion.”\n\nDirectly addressing Germany, Penn declared: “We’ve seen that the German government has lately been, I think, a little clearer-minded in beginning to move support to Ukraine. … As I said earlier today, we should all be supporting the supply of long-range precision weapons. That’s a key priority for the Ukrainians.”\n\nThe exploitation of one of the world’s most popular film festivals for bloodthirsty militaristic propaganda against Russia in a conflict that could rapidly escalate into a world war threatening the survival of humanity is unprecedented in Germany’s postwar history. It represents a grievous assault on the principle of artistic independence and must serve as a grave warning to the international working class.",

        "text": "New Nature Paper On Starving Polar Bears Is Pure Propaganda, Not News \n\n Is it a coincidence that a paper reporting the results of a no-news study on polar bears, which predicts future starvation due to climate change, was published two weeks to the day ahead of a climate change marketing event made up by the activist organization Polar Bears International? I doubt it. [emphasis, links added]\n\nAnd do I think the high-profile journal Nature Communications would not only agree to publish such a useless bit of propaganda but also rig the timing to advance the climate change emergency narrative? Silly question.\n\nAnd the media worldwide are of course lapping it up, happy for an excuse to promote the perils of climate change, see here, here, and here using images of fat polar bears.\n\nThe image above is from the BBC headline, 13 February 2024.\n\nThey believe this strategy is effective because they think the public is stupid, but they are deluding themselves. Most people are now laughing at their obvious acts of desperation.\n\nPolar bears are highly specialized for consuming large amounts of fat from Arctic seals, whales, and walruses.\n\nOnly a few vocal researchers outside mainstream polar bear science insist that polar bears could ever survive year-round by eating terrestrial foods (e.g., Ilses et al. 2013; Iverson et al. 2014; Gormezano and Rockwell 2013a,b; Prop et al. 2015; Rogers et al. 2015; Tartu et al. 2016).\n\nI agree with leading polar bear specialists that, based on polar bear biology, only a few individual bears derive any survival benefit from foods they find or catch on land, like birds, eggs, and reindeer — [except for] beached carcasses of whales, walrus, and seals that still have fat on them (Crockford 2022; Rode et al. 2015).\n\nI’ve said this a number of times on this blog, and in my Polar Bear Evolution book (Crockford 2023) and the Polar Bear Catastrophe That Never Happened (Crockford 2019).\n\nAs I’ve said before:\n\nWhatever food polar bears consume in the summer – whether they are on land or on the ice – doesn’t really matter. What matters is how many fat-rich seals they can consume between March and June each year. The fat put on in late winter/spring from gorging on baby seals carries polar bears over the summer, no matter where they spend it. … Well-fed bears throughout the Arctic have enough fat to see them through a 4-5 month fast and even the worst-case scenario models devised suggest that most bears in productive regions like Hudson Bay [and probably, Southern Davis Strait] would survive a 6 month fast. …Chukchi Sea and Southern Davis Strait bears, for example, are doing very well – contrary to all predictions – despite marked declines in summer sea ice because they have ample food during their critical spring feeding period when sea ice is abundant.”\n\nThe study\n\nThe paper by Pagano and colleagues (2024) looked at data from 20 Western Hudson Bay polar bears over three years (August-September, 2019-2022) to see what they ate and how much they were active during the ice-free period they spent onshore.\n\nAll but one of the bears still lost about 1kg per day regardless of what they ate, except the one bear that had found a seal carcass. The authors found a wide degree of individual variation in activity and terrestrial foods consumed among the bears, as any rational person would expect.\n\nPolar bear specialist Jon Aars is quoted as saying:\n\n“The area of this study is one where conditions may be very difficult for bears within a short time, if sea ice continues to disappear as predicted.”\n\nHowever, sea ice in WH has not changed markedly since a step-change around 1998: although there is year-to-year variation, the amount of time that polar bears must spend onshore has not changed since then (about three weeks longer than in the 1980s), which is certainly not what was predicted given the increase in human-generated CO2 emissions over the last two and a half decades.\n\nThey never talk about the starving bears in Western Hudson Bay in 1983, before there was a sea ice issue.\n\nThe bear below was captured with three cubs in November weighing only 218 lbs; over the winter she lost her cubs but was captured in July the following year after she had gained almost 700 lbs over the spring feeding period and pregnant again (Ramsay and Stirling 1988:615).\n\nOther bears were in similarly poor condition that year and the survival of cubs was low. While polar bear biologists have not been able to say why, it wasn’t a lack of sea ice (Derocher and Stirling 1992; 1995).\n\nThe “science” being touted in this new paper is a waste of precious time and money: it only confirmed what was already known. It did not advance our knowledge about polar bears in any meaningful way.\n\nThe last line of the paper confirms the whole point of the publication was propaganda:\n\n“Ultimately, our findings reinforce the risk of starvation for polar bears on land with forecasted increases in the onshore period.” [my bold]\n\nThis is a pertinent time to remind everyone that when polar bears die, they almost always die of starvation because they have no natural enemies. Starvation is a natural cause of death for polar bears and is virtually never caused by a lack of sea ice.",

        "text": "Is Brussels serving US interests? – Part 2 \n\n Is Brussels serving US interests? – Part 2\n\nWhether we look at the handling of the war situation, the migration or the energy crisis, we see that the actions of Europe's decision-makers seek to favour US globalists, instead of serving the interests of Europeans. In its series of articles, V4NA attempts to find out what is behind all this. We examined the background of those in the \"EU government\" – the commissioners of the European Commission – and it became clear in the case of many individuals, at times with just a brief investigation, that they are members of George Soros's globalist network.\n\nThe past of the European Commission’s president includes an intrinsic connection to the US oligarch, as Germany’s former defense minister Ursula von der Leyen served in the same organisation – – the advisory board of the Munich Security Conference – as Alexander Soros, the heir apparent of his father’s Open Society network. Although Ms von der Leyen is no longer a member of this advisory board, it is worth noting that, besides Alexander Soros, it boasts a number of illustrious leftist-liberal members such as David Miliband, president of IRC, an international organisation helping migrants, or Radoslaw Sikorski, Poland’s former foreign minister. Mr Sikorski’s wife, Anne Applebaum, is a true representative of the US speculator’s interests. It is worthy of mention that the historian of Polish descent is also present on the advisory board of Action for Democracy (AD), an pseudo-NGO implicated in the Hungarian left wing’s illicit foreign funding scandal.\n\nReturning to the EC chief, the above image portraying her in 2012 as Germany’s labour and social affairs minister in informal talks with George Soros and another investor, Nicolas Berggruen, went viral shortly after it was taken. One wonders what the discussions were about…\n\nFrans Timmermans is a friend of George Soros\n\nLooking at the other members of the European Commission, such as first VP Frans Timmermans, the suspicion that the EC is completely tethered to US globalist forces grows even stronger.\n\nMr Timmermans makes no effort whatsoever to hide his affinity for Mr Soros and his open society concepts. In an earlier interview, he called the billionaire his friend. As one of the EU leaders with whom the globalist tycoon has met most frequently in recent years, Mr Timmermans expressed his appreciation for Mr Soros on numerous occasions, repeatedly defending the US speculator.\n\nThis is what the EC First VP said about him a few years ago: „I have no doubt that he is sincerely and truly committed to freedom, democracy and an open society that guarantees equal rights to its citizens. I have shared this commitment myself throughout my professional career, and I will stick to it until my last breath.”\n\nMr Timmermans and his immediate colleagues held several meetings with the George Soros’s organisations, for example with the European Policy Center (EPC), or with Avaaz, and with representatives of the Open Society European Policy Institute (OSEPI), the Kontra news portal pointed out in an earlier article. The Hungarian site’s piece also mentions Valdis Dombrovskis, the executive VP in charge of promoting a human-centric economy, who met with representatives of The Project Syndicate, considered the billionaire’s ‘message board’, in Brussels on 25 February 2020.\n\nIn light of this, perhaps it comes as little surprise that Mr Timmermans, himself a hypocritical waster of energy, was one of the strongest proponents of extending sanctions to include, among other things, energy carriers, which mostly served the economic interests the US.\n\nMargrethe Vestager, Soros’s hammer in the fight with the tech giants\n\nAnother of the EC’s executive vice-presidents, Margrethe Vestager, also maintains intensive ties with Mr Soros. According to press reports from 2018, Ms Vestager and Mr Timmermans held a joint meeting with the billionaire and discussed a number of issues. „I’ve been talking to George Soros periodically for at least twenty years now, and the topic is always the same. How can we help to strengthen cohesion in Europe? It all started with the realisation that although Europe’s division has ended, a lot of work and effort must be made in order for the two halves of Europe to really get closer to each other. Mr Soros was committed to this goal from the beginning, and this has also been my task in some shape and form,” Mr Timmermans said at the time.\n\nBut a few years ago, when Google and Facebook were in the midst of a feud with George Soros, the speculator himself praised Ms Vestager, saying that she would be the fate of these big companies in Europe.\n\nJosep Borell had a confidential meeting with Soros on migrant boats\n\nJosep Borrell Fontelles, EU high commissioner in charge of promoting the EU as a global leader, made a statement a few days ago, which caused palpable outrage. Following a session of foreign ministers, the Spanish politician said that no one expected European sanctions to stop Russia’s war. This, however, is in complete contradiction to the statements made by EU officials in the spring and especially in the early summer, when sanctions on Russian energy were being rammed through the member states.\n\nEarlier, as Spain’s foreign minister, Mr Borrell held an hours-long discussion with George Soros in the company of Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez. The discussion may have focused on promoting the resettlement of migrants in Europe, according to leaks in the press, something that served the US speculator’s interests. Today, they unanimously argue in favour of the sanctions.\n\nMr Borell, however, makes no secret of his commitment to the Soros empire, so much so that in September 2022 he published an article on Project Syndicate, in which he also argued that the strategy against the Russians was working and should be continued. As is known, Project Syndicate is George Soros’s homegrown media outlet, also known as the speculator’s private „message board”.\n\n„True, Russia has benefited from the recent gas price increases. but this does not mean that sanctions have failed. Instead, we should wait to see the full impact of Europe’s decision to reduce its energy imports from Russia,” the senior official explained.\n\nThe EU commissioner, who has millions in assets, has mockingly described Brussels’ anti-Russia sanctions impoverishing Europe as part of a „reduced diet.” In the meantime, during a period of war and epidemics, he has increased his wealth by hundreds of thousands of euros in recent years, as his asset declaration reveals. At the time, V4NA has covered that story.\n\nJohannes Hahn may have been involved in EU misappropriations case\n\nJohannes Hahn, the Commissioner for Budget and Administration, also proudly posed with George Soros a few years ago, saying „it is always good to meet with George Soros to discuss our joint efforts to accelerate reforms in the Balkans and Eastern Europe”.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, it comes as no surprise that Commissioner Hahn is working to sink Europe ever deeper in debt in a bid to finance Ukraine’s operations from loans, pushing the EU to the brink of economic collapse.\n\nThe budget commissioner’s troubled finances were exposed by the Hungarian Kontra news outlet, which wrote that Mr Hahn may have been involved in a European Union misappropriations case. During his the previous term the Austrian politician was in charge of European Neighbourhood Policy and Enlargement Negotiations. His office was audited by the European Court of Auditors chaired by Karel Pinxten, who is also implicated in the most egregious misappropriations scandal of the EU’s history.\n\nMr Hahn attended Ms Pinxten’s luxury dinners and hunting adventures on several occasions, including on 12 and 13 December 2015. Although their bills were covered by the European Court of Auditors, i.e. European taxpayers, Mr Hahn somehow did not consider these invitations important enough to mention them in the name of transparency. He also maintains close ties with Helga Berger, a member of the Court of Auditors’ chamber that oversees his current portfolio.\n\nAccording to the French newspaper, the two Austrian officials also dined together on 11, 14 and 28 June 2021.\n\nOLAF, an institution tasked with thoroughly investigating and controlling all financial and funding irregularities, has remained eerily silent both in the Pinxten case and during the preliminary investigation concerning the dealings of Commissioner Johannes Hahn.\n\nSuccumbing to the amount of pressure coming from the Commission and unnamed member states, the organisation eventually decided to drop (at least) the latter case, the French Liberation reported. And today, the Commissioner in charge of overseeing OLAF is none other than former Budget Commissioner Johannes Hahn.\n\nTags:",

The globalist façade of transformational benevolence is quickly losing its luster, so now they are resorting to even more climate rhetoric. (Related: Remember when Germany banned Europeans from entering the country during the covid scamdemic while at the same time welcoming \"migrants\" with open arms?)\n\nEarlier this year, the WEF announced that the plan is to usher another 200 million \"climate refugees\" into the West by the year 2050. If this is not achieved, this will create a \"risk to global stability,\" the globalist entity threatened.\n\nThe World Bank, another globalist-controlled entity, threw out a similar but slightly higher number of 216 million climate migrants, including 86 million just from sub-Saharan Africa, that will need to flood the West by mid-century in order to keep the globalist plot on schedule.\n\nIn a report entitled \"Global Risks Report 2022,\" the WEF further demands that westerners not only welcome all these climate migrants with open arms, but also allow them to enter and occupy their \"homes, communities, and jobs.\"\n\nIf you want to know why everything is becoming prohibitively expensive, including basics like food and housing, look no further than this flood of illegals into the country. These people are consuming scarce and precious resources while actual citizens suffer.\n\nThis is what the globalists want, after all. Whites must suffer and give up everything so non-whites can replace them, allowing the powers that be full reign over the planet.\n\nOne of the biggest things standing in their way are the growing populist and nationalist movements. Even if it was just words, this is the message that President Donald Trump conveyed to the nation with his \"America First\" agenda.\n\nThe WEF report addresses this, and you can clearly see from the following that the globalists are fearful that We the People will wake up and resist our collective genocide at their devious hands:\n\n\"Disillusionment with globalization has fuelled nativist discourses and national interest policies in many destination countries in recent years, ... Many governments, reflecting popular attitudes, have expressed concern about pressures on education and healthcare services, housing capacity and local employment; for others, integration concerns have been a priority.\"\n\nThere are attempts being made to convince Western citizens that this large-scale invasion of 'climate migrants' is somehow good for their countries. The WEF report claims that economic migration \"often has considerable benefits for both origin and destination countries.\"\n\nThis is a lie, of course, as the only people who benefit from such policies are the globalists. Everyone else suffers under the crushing economic pressure of hordes of illegals swarming and occupying once-thriving communities that have been devastated by many decades of globalist meddling.",

The Associated Press did not bother to explain to its readers or the newspapers that run its stories why these organizations were impelled to throw millions at it except sheer benevolence.\n\nNor did it explain why they might be particularly interested in convincing Americans that the climate sky is falling and that our economy must be dismantled and ‘greened’: raising energy prices and putting millions out of work.\n\nOne of those five organizations, Quadrivium, was created by James Murdoch and his wife, who left the Murdoch (of Fox and Fox News origins) family over disagreements with conservative news coverage. The organization says it hopes to reach “a majority of the public” in order to generate “urgent action” on the \"bipartisan passage of a US climate strategy.”\n\nThe idea being pushed is called the \"carbon rebate plan,\" and it involves taxing Americans via their carbon emissions with the promise of repaying some of the money back to them. It comes from an organization called the Climate Leadership Council, whose board includes James' wife, Kathryn Murdoch. The group's partners include major banks like JP Morgan, Santander, and Goldman Sachs, as well as energy companies BP, Shell, and Conoco, the latter of whom believe, for some reason, that they'll be spared from bankruptcy if they go along with the lunacy.\n\nMedia organizations like the AP begin to play their role with climate change propaganda pieces like “Carbon tax plan worthy of bipartisan support.\" The newswire's editorial board described the CLC as a “group of venerable Republicans” while laughably claiming that taxing Americans for the benefit of special climate interests is “a quintessentially conservative plan\" -- though conservatives and Republicans, in general, push for tax cuts and minimum government in everyone's lives.\n\n\"Serious journalism would ask questions or at least mention some of this in passing. The AP instead acts as a mouthpiece without even enough lingering self-respect to disclose any of that,\" Greenfield writes.\n\nAs for the Murdochs, they have invested in several projects that include pushing leftist climate policies, all of which empower government and companies over hapless consumers who are expected to simply go along with the scheme. Most of the 'convincing' revolves around scaring people to death with false claims of how cattle flatulence and SUVs have put the earth on a short-term timetable to destruction. And, of course, every warning becomes more dire.\n\nBut the AP doesn't mention any of this, as Greenfield notes.\n\n\"The AP is taking money from organizations heavily leveraged in green investments to promote the need for green investments. And it fails to disclose the financial interests that its funders have in promoting global warming hysteria,\" he writes, adding: \"The next time you see an AP story about 'climate change,' you know who’s paying for it.\"\n\nSources include:",

To which I reply, it’s high time we wash the WEF right out of our hair.\n\nThere is no “climate crisis”; it’s an ideological fantasy of leftists bent on increasing their power and wealth while restricting our liberties and rights. Indeed, WEF is very dedicated to demanding that we give up our property, vacations, cars, and apparently even our hygiene because The Science™ told us so. Not that such rules will apply to the elites, of course. They will continue to travel the world in private jets from their vast seaside estates to luxury hotels from which they will tell us washing our undies is killing the planet. Both WEF and the Biden administration often align on harmful climate policies; for instance, WEF’s First Movers Coalition website prominently features a quote from former Biden Special Presidential Envoy for Climate and current Biden campaign supporter John Kerry.\n\nIn its undated video “Scientists Are Urging Us To Wash Our Clothes Less To Help The Planet,” newly re-circulating on Twitter/X, filthy rich (pun intended) WEF condescendingly explains why we must wash our clothes less often. The video — which might not be very recent, but which still perfectly encapsulates WEF’s ideology — explains that scientists claim “laundry has a ‘huge environmental impact.’ 70% of the CO2 emissions generated by a cotton T-shirt come from washing and drying it.”\n\nAs a very important side note, carbon is absolutely essential for all life on earth, and there is evidence that increased carbon is beneficial for plants — including food crops. So, actually, increasing CO2 emissions are no cause for worry or panic. WEF is scaremongering ideologically, not scientifically, no matter what vague group of “experts” they cite.\n\nWEF’s video continues, “Laundry also puts detergents and microfibres into waterways[,] Which is damaging to ecosystems. Too much washing also wears out clothes faster[,] Meaning more are sent to landfill. The EU alone produces 2.2 million tonnes of textile waste a year.” WEF adds, “Experts at the Society of Chemical Industry say we shouldn’t wash clothes after every wear… They say jeans shouldn’t be washed more than once a month[,] Jumpers once a fortnight[,] And pyjamas once a week.” These experts sound like certifiable nutcases. Either that or they have absolutely no sense of smell. WEF did generously add, “The exceptions are underwear and gym clothes, which should be washed every wear.”\n\nI would say here, as a personal comment, that if clothes do wear out faster now (and WEF is hardly an objective source), it’s because they are made more cheaply and shoddily than ever, not because they’re being washed too often. I have clothes that belonged to my great-aunts that are in better shape after a century of regular washing than the Chinese slave labor-made clothes from Amazon are after three weeks. WEF is whining about the wrong problem. But since WEF is enthusiastically admiring of Communist China, slave labor and all, that’s not a surprise.\n\nThe WEF video concludes, “If using a machine, try lower temperatures and shorter cycles. How often do you wash your clothes?” As often as I wear them, WEF. And that won’t change no matter how many fossil fuel-guzzling globalist elites or Biden officials screech that the planet is dying.",

        "text": "Arrest Warrant Issued for Putin for War Crimes? Hold on a Minute! \n\n By Janet Phelan The International Criminal Court at the Hague has issued an arrest warrant for President Vladimir Putin of Russia. NPR reports that “The International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin for alleged war crimes involving accusations that Russia has forcibly taken Ukrainian children.” At the very same time that these charges are being launched against Putin, these stories about forcible taking of children in the US appeared in my newsfeed.\n\nThis investigation alleges that children are being taken for profit by America’s justice system. A snapshot of this story states that these children remain in custody despite orders for their release. And here is an article concerning a federal judge ordering a thirteen-year-old girl handcuffed during a hearing involving her father. The article alleges that what Judge Benitez did to the young girl constitutes torture. And this story reveals sex-trafficking of children in the state of Florida, which resulted in some arrests. All these stories took place in “the land of the free,” where every day there are new accusations of atrocities committed by DCFS and the courts in pursuit of removing children from their homes. But this is America, right? And America cannot be accused of war crimes when it is not at war, right? Besides, we’re the good guys. Right? The US (like Russia) does not recognize the International Criminal Court. So charges which could potentially be launched against the US are usually not attended to by the court or its attorneys. However, that reality does not seem to affect the relationship between Russia and the ICC.\n\nA recent effort involved contacting the entire list of ICC-certified attorneys in the US concerning allegations that the US is now using covert weaponry against some of its citizens, in clear violation of crimes against humanity codified in the Rome Statute. As the US does not recognize the Rome Statute, you can probably guess how many US attorneys were interested in taking on the case, despite an accumulation of damning evidence. None. There seems to be a peculiar amount of heady influence that the US wields at the ICC. Clearly, it would appear that with neither the US nor Russia recognizing the Rome Statute and the jurisdiction of the ICC that there would be some equality in the dispensation of attention to war crimes, crimes of genocide and crimes against humanity committed by either nation. However, this appears not to be the case. In light of the hundreds of thousands of US families now victimized by the forcible taking of children through actions by DCFS and the courts, one might hope that there would be equal attention paid to this issue at the ICC. Unless the ICC is also owned by US interests. Given the circumstances cited above, this possibility needs further investigation.\n\nNPR goes on to report Russia’s responses to the ICC charges: “The very question itself is outrageous and unacceptable,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. “Russia, like a number of other states, does not recognize the jurisdiction of this court, and therefore any of its decisions are insignificant for the Russian Federation from a legal viewpoint.” “Legal viewpoint.” Now that is an interesting perspective. We’ll be watching this international “legal” action to see if the “legal” aspect is indeed the prevailing issue here or if the power being exerted through the ICC moves to the foreground.

Yevgeny Satanovsky is one of Russian television's most popular pro-Putin pals. From making several claims about nuclear weapons, to calling Putin an “Emperor”, he is often used by Kremlin-back television as the arbiter of big claims.

        "text": "How this little-known Eurasian economic bloc helped blunt Western sanctions \n\n How this little-known Eurasian economic bloc helped blunt Western sanctions\n\nThe rumble of guns is now so loud across the world that it’s easy to forget that there can be any relationship between states other than those based on brute force. But that is not the case.\n\nHowever fierce the contradictions between the great powers may be, international politics and economics are not all about conflict. There is always room for cooperation, which is no less natural to human nature than competition and coercion. And it would be a mistake to ‘fall for’ the West’s suggestion that the benefits are only one-sided – it is not necessarily the case. It only becomes so if the US and its Western European satellites initially see cooperation as a one-way street. The opposite is true, in reality. And it even produces quite tangible results.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of dramatic events in the zone of direct confrontation between Russia and the West, the ten-year anniversary of a unique organization uniting five countries of the former USSR went virtually unnoticed by observers. We are talking about the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), whose founding treaty was signed in Astana in May 2014.\n\nDuring those days, when Ukraine was sinking deeper and deeper into the abyss of civil war, the leaders of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia created an association of states with the main purpose of building favorable conditions for business. To think that this was premature, given the growing global crisis, is to distrust the strategic intentions of the three most experienced politicians of their time.\n\nThis is first and foremost because no conflict, even the most violent, should lead to the freezing of all other life. We in Russia have already seen this for ourselves during two years of confrontation with the West in Ukraine. The efforts of a modern state cannot be focused only on violent confrontation – because then it risks losing the time needed for development. Moreover, in the context of growing pressure from the US and EU on Russia’s position in Eastern Europe, the creation of a purely economic union was a bold, asymmetric response to this challenge.\n\nThe EAEU is first and foremost an experiment in organizing a fundamentally new way of life on a large scale. We have never tried anything like it before and, luckily, we took the risk. So far, the experiment is working and has already passed two serious tests: the Covid pandemic and a barrage of Western sanctions against the EAEU’s largest economy, Russia.\n\nInitially, however, the feasibility of the project was questionable. After the collapse of the USSR in 1991, any close cooperation between Russia and its other former republics was seen as having only two alternatives: a mechanism for civilized divorce or a way of restoring a unified state.\n\nThis view partly reflected a lack of experience of relations other than the subordination of all to a single vertical of power. The other option for relations between Russia and its neighbors was mutual rejection by increasingly isolated nation-states. The West’s assessments and recommendations had actively contributed to making this the way forward. The US-led group has always been interested in hostility between other countries of the world. And they’ve tried to instil the idea of its inevitability into everyone’s consciousness. We have to admit that they were quite successful.\n\nDmitry Trenin: Europe will eventually have to choose between the US and BRICS\n\nThat is why the EU and the US have never recognized the EAEU and refuse to engage in direct dialogue with it. Unlike China, which signed a cooperation agreement in 2015. The reason is that the West immediately sensed in the EAEU the most dangerous thing possible for the implementation of its plans – that there could be solutions other than those offered to the world by Washington and Brussels. In the long run, this is even worse for the West than political disagreements, simply because an essential part of its power lies in the absence of any choice for other states.\n\nAs soon as such options appear, the West’s fascination disappears. The most vivid example is modern Georgia, which has gone from being a pariah country to a fairly reliable participant in Eurasian economic relations.\n\nSince the creation of the EAEU, mutual trade between its member countries has almost doubled, and their foreign trade has grown by 60%. Industrial production has increased by 22% and agricultural production by 25%. At the same time, investment in fixed capital has increased by a third, and the volume of bilateral settlements in national currencies has reached 90% in recent years. All this shows that in just 10 years the EAEU has become a vitally important driver of national economic growth for its members.\n\nThe most impressive growth rates, directly related to participation in the EAEU common market, have been achieved by Armenia and Kyrgyzstan – small service economies. Like the Netherlands in Western Europe, they fulfil the functions of intermediate countries. Especially after the beginning of the Western economic war against Russia and Belarus, this type of activity has become the most in demand. In Armenia, GDP grew at a record rate of 11-13% in 2022-2023, and Kyrgyzstan set new records.\n\nWith few exceptions, the openness of the markets creates reasons for Russia’s EAEU partners to be more resistant to Western pressure to support sanctions. Pressure can be successful in areas where the West dominates the financial infrastructure. But in cases where the open market operates, it becomes completely powerless.\n\n‘Has the West Successfully Demonized Russia?’ RT panel: Key takeaways\n\nTrade between EAEU countries and those partners in Europe with whom Russia has virtually cut off economic relations has also grown significantly. The current Armenian government cannot be considered pro-Russian at all, and there is room for serious misunderstandings in our relations. But no one is even considering the possibility of voluntarily curtailing economic ties. And the longer the relationship is driven by market logic rather than politics, the more dangerous it will be for any government to take drastic steps.\n\nIn other words, the practice of Eurasian integration has shown that the quiet work of officials can be a very effective weapon against the West’s attempts to isolate everyone. And it is completely superfluous to speculate now on how long and geographically large the integration project will be in the future. Eurasian integration has already existed for ten years and is bringing tangible economic benefits to its participants. Let us repeat: the benefits are now, not in the “bright future” that the European Union promises to the countries that depend on it.\n\nThis is the difference between a forward-looking model of development and a dead-end one: the former focuses on the outcome now, while the latter is based on the probability of complete happiness and prosperity sometime in the future. The second path has, as we know, been taken by Ukraine, where every coup d’état – and the resultant bloodshed – has been driven by the promise that something delightful lies ahead. The result is obvious. The other way is to work patiently to increase the number of people who personally benefit from good rather than bad relations between countries.",

        "text": "Russia ‘Firm Supporter of Multipolar World’: Key Takeaways of Moscow Security Conference \n\nRussian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu earlier touted the conference as “a much-needed venue” to publicly discuss the most pressing global and regional security issues.\n\nThe XI Moscow Conference on International Security opened in the town of Kubinka outside Moscow on Tuesday, with an array of senior Russian and foreign officials delivering online speeches at the event, titled “Realities of global security in a multipolar world.”\n\nThey included President Vladimir Putin, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov of Russia, as well as Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko and Chinese Defense Minister Li Shangfu.\n\nRussian President Putin: Global Community Should Create 'Contours of the Future'\n\nIn his video address to participants, President Putin stressed the importance of conducting global security-related discussions “in the context of the formation of a multipolar world.”\n\n“Such open, honest, and unbiased discussions are extremely important today, because all of us - the entire international community - will have to create the contours of the future,\" the Russian president said.\n\nHe stressed that Russia remains a “firm supporter of a multipolar world order based on the priority of the norms and principles of international law, as well as the sovereignty and equality of states, constructive cooperation and trust.\"\n\nThe Russian head of state recalled that nowadays, both long-standing and new conflicts are being inflated in different regions of the world. The goal of those who fuel these conflicts is to “mercilessly” capitalize on the natural resources of the countries involved in the standoffs, Putin added.\n\nIn this vein, he touched upon the Ukraine conflict, pointing to “billions of dollars being pumped into [Kiev’s] neo-Nazi regime, which is also provided with military equipment and ammunition, as well as military advisers and mercenaries.” Putin emphasized that “everything is being done to further ignite this conflict and draw other states into it.”\n\nSeparately, the Russian president recalled that NATO countries continue to build up and modernize their offensive capabilities as the US is seeking “to reformat” the system of interstate interaction that has developed in the Asia-Pacific region for the sake of Washington’s interests.\n\nHe accused NATO members of trying to transfer military confrontation to outer and information space, and using military and non-military means of pressure. “What’s more, all this is happening against the backdrop of the destruction of the arms control system,” Putin underscored.\n\nRussian Defense Minister Shoigu: Ukraine's Military Resource 'Almost Exhausted'\n\nDefense Minister Sergei Shoigu, for his part, focused on issues related to Russia’s ongoing special military operation in Ukraine, which “put an end to the West’s domination in military sphere.” According to him, Western countries can no longer impose their will on other nations.\n\nThe Russian defense minister stressed that \"Preliminary results of hostilities indicate that Ukraine's military resource is almost exhausted.\"\n\nHe made it clear that Russia is ready to share assessments of ineffectiveness of Western technology with its partners, referring to Ukraine’s military equipment that it earlier received from the US and its allies.\n\n\"I would like to stress once again that there is nothing unique or indestructible for Russian weapons on the battlefield today. In many cases, even Soviet-made equipment is superior in its combat characteristics to Western models. We have objective monitoring data on the destruction of German tanks, US armored vehicles, UK missiles and other weapon systems,” Shoigu said.\n\nHe added that some of Ukraine’s Western-supplied weapons that have been seized by Russian forces are currently on display at the Patriot Park in Kubinka.\n\nShoigu also dwelt on the “alarming situation” around the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant, saying that “Kiev exposes it to regular shelling from heavy weapons.” According to the Russian defense minister, “the actions of the Ukrainian Armed Forces can provoke a nuclear catastrophe.”\n\nHe also said that as far as the special operation is concerned, Russia has so far refrained from using cluster munitions, but that Moscow may reconsider its decision.\n\n\"I would like to draw attention to the fact that we also have cluster munitions in service. Until now, we have refrained from using them for humanitarian reasons. However, this decision can be reconsidered,\" Shoigu emphasized, adding that the US is committing a war crime by using cluster munitions in Ukraine.\n\nSpeaking of the Black Sea Grain Initiative, he said that Kiev used it as a cover-up for its weapons and ammunition depots to protect them from Russian missile strikes.\n\n\"The Kiev regime has shown particular cynicism in the implementation of the Black Sea Grain Initiative. By using it as a cover from Russian missile strikes, Kiev has amassed weapons and ammunition in Odessa and other Black Sea ports, which were routinely delivered to the front line,\" the Russian defense minister said.\n\nHe separately touched upon relations between Russia and China, which Shoigu said “exceeded the level of strategic partnership in all respects, becoming more than allied ones.”\n\nChinese Defense Minister Li Shangfu: Beijing Ready to Bolster Security Work Within SCO\n\nThe Russian defense minister was echoed by Chinese counterpart Li Shangfu, who told the Moscow conference that military relations between Beijing and Moscow are not directed against third countries.\n\nLi also signaled his country’s readiness to step up security work within the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and bolster defense cooperation with Iran and Belarus.\n\n\"China is willing, as before, to strengthen security work within the SCO, and actively deepen defense cooperation with new SCO country Iran and Belarus, which is joining the organization,\" the Chinese defense minister underlined, adding that Beijing is ready to strengthen international cooperation on arms control.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Lavrov: West Tries to Destroy Security Architecture in Asia-Pacific\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, in turn, berated Washington, NATO and the EU for providing Ukraine with weapons, which he said might spark a direct military conflict between nuclear powers.\n\n\"The United States, NATO and the European Union are pumping Kiev with more modern weapons, fomenting the Ukraine conflict further and provoking the uncontrolled spread of weapons across the world. Their adventurous and irresponsible policy significantly increases the threat of a direct military clash between nuclear powers,\" Lavrov pointed out.\n\nHe accused Western countries of trying to scrap the security architecture in the Asia-Pacific region and create military blocs there for promoting NATO infrastructure.\n\n\"Having proclaimed the indivisibility of the security of the Euro-Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific region, NATO members crossed out all their previous mantra about the purely defensive nature of the alliance and officially declared that from now on, they will not only protect their territory, but will also promote their dominance in this region, the top Russian diplomat stressed.\n\nLavrov also said that Russia is concerned over the US’ apparent drive “to derail’ the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, “one of the cornerstone elements of the global security architecture.”\n\n\"In particular, we observe that such risks are being created as a result of the US’ clear attempts to withdraw from the procedure of this treaty the Anglo-Saxon nuclear project within the framework of the new military bloc AUKUS,\" the Russian foreign minister said.\n\nBelarusian President Lukashenko: International Situation 'Severely Tense'\n\nIn his written address to participants of the Moscow conference, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, for his part, warned that the global political situation remains “severely tense” due to the aggravation of \"practically all known challenges and threats.\"\n\nHe said that “there are growing risks of using weapons of mass destruction, including provocations related to using nuclear and biological weapons.\"\n\n“Against this background, […] Minsk along with its partners and within the framework of the Union State of Belarus and Russia, makes every effort to strengthen cooperation in the fight against transnational challenges and threats of various nature \", Lukashenko stressed.\n\nRussian Foreign Intel Service Chief: America Cracks Down on Any Alternative Stance\n\nIn his speech at the conference, Sergey Naryshkin, chief of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service, in particular, spoke of the West’s biased approach to freedom of expression, referring to “Americans and Europeans cracking down on the spread of any alternative viewpoints that undermine their dominant narrative.”\n\n“Not only the news agencies RT and Sputnik, which have a large audience, but even small media resources that oppose the deceitful Western officialdom are being shut down and sanctioned. In a number of the most rabid Russophobic countries, liability over viewing illegal content has already been introduced,” he emphasized.",

        "text": "The Green Movement Is a Jobs Killer. Are Unions Finally Figuring This Out? \n\n Commentary. Could it be that union bosses are finally waking up to the cold reality that the greatest threat to steel workers, the United Auto Workers, miners, machinists, and the Teamsters is the radical climate change agenda of the environmentalists? \n\nThe green movement has taken the Democratic Party hostage—and President Joe Biden’s all-in embrace of far-left green policies is wreaking havoc on rank-and-file union jobs. The United Auto Workers (UAW) recently announced it would withhold its endorsement of Biden as he runs for a second term. “The federal government is pouring billions into the electric vehicle transition, with no strings attached and no commitment to workers,” UAW President Shawn Fain recently declared. “The EV transition is at serious risk of becoming a race to the bottom” for America’s workers. My only question: Why did it take five years to figure this out? What a shock that a union that makes automobiles would have second thoughts about endorsing the reelection of a president who, just a few weeks ago, announced new regulations that are intended to end production of all gas cars within a decade. That’s a death sentence for UAW workers. Meanwhile, California Democrats have proposed new rules to end the production of nearly 2 million diesel trucks. Has anyone alerted the Teamsters? These rules would crush unions like Godzilla stomping on a twig. Perhaps the UAW is finally realizing that Biden’s goal is to get all traditional cars and trucks off the road. That’s not going to leave many card-carrying UAW members left to pay dues. \n\nMeanwhile, the electric cars and the parts will be made in China and developing countries controlled by Beijing. To his credit, Biden is only doing what he promised back in 2020. He declared war on energy and the combustible engine—and yet the union bosses endorsed him. Most amazing was the United Mine Workers and some of the Pipefitters unions endorsing Biden. Apparently, they weren’t paying attention to his stated goal of shutting down every coal mine in America and most oil and gas pipelines. Talk about selling the rope to your own hangman. Rank-and-file hard-hat union members are on to this gambit—which is why most private-sector union voters went for former President Donald Trump in the last two election cycles, even as the union bosses endorsed and gave tens of millions of dollars to Hillary Clinton and then Biden. Even now, as Biden cozies up to the Sierra Club and Greenpeace and places a metaphorical blade at the neck of the blue-collar union workers, the union bosses are reluctant to call for a divorce with “lunch bucket Joe.” After acknowledging the threat that Biden posed to the livelihoods of tens of thousands of union members, the UAW’s Fain warned that “another Donald Trump presidency would be a disaster.” How? Union workers saw huge job and wage gains when Trump was president. \n\nFain even muttered some disingenuous mumbo-jumbo about getting behind a “pro-worker, pro-climate” agenda for the working class. That’s an oxymoron. This isn’t complicated. The leftists’ religious pursuit of “zero emissions” leads to a green holy land with no smokestacks, no power plants, no cars, no trucks, no steel mills, copper mines, pipelines, gas stoves, air conditioners, airplanes, nuclear plants, washers and dryers, pesticides, plastics, or cows and other livestock. Oh—and as we sprint to a new post-industrial-age America, with no need for blue-collar unionized workers. The green “degrowth” movement isn’t about creating prosperity for union workers but about putting them on unemployment lines. It’s good news that the Big Labor bosses are finally expressing some doubts about what the climate change agenda means for hard-hat workers. But if they keep working to elect climate change crazies, the demise of our union workforce will be swift and brutal.

Putin's pronouncement from Monday suggests that Russia aspires to have a greater presence in Latin America. \n\nIt could also be a retaliatory measure against the United States and other Western powers for supporting Ukraine in its war with Russia which has been an ongoing occurrence since Russian invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. \n\n\"Russia sincerely cherishes the historical strong, friendly, truly trusting ties with the states of Latin America, Asia, and Africa and is ready to offer its partners and allies the most modern types of weapons.

Past actions, however, suggest possible partnerships with Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela. If that's the case, Russia could potentially load up the triad with guns and other combat necessities while providing \"military cooperation\" in the region. Putin's Monday speech runs similar to what Russia announced in January, in terms of wanting to strengthen its cooperation with Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela \"in all [military] areas.\" \n\nAccording to Breitbart News, Venezuela has become the region's biggest purchaser of Russian arms, buying guns, combat airplanes and missiles.

You, too, should be afraid while also taking the strongest action you can take.\"\n\n\"There has never been a summer like this in recorded history: shocking ocean heat, deadly land heat, unprecedented fires and smoke, sea ice melting faster than we've ever seen or thought possible,\" Kalmus adds, noting that he has \"dreaded this depth of Earth breakdown for almost two decades.\"\n\n(Related: Did you know that the so-called \"Climate Emergency Fund\" is just an eco-money laundering scheme in disguise?)\n\nIn Kalmus' view, the primary culprit in \"global heating,\" as he calls it, is the continued burning of fossil fuels, which are just earth-based fuels naturally produced by the planet for humanity's benefit.\n\nIn Kalmus' deranged world, fossil fuels are evil and must be kept inside the earth where they come from, never to be used as energy in cars, heating systems, or anything else.\n\n\"... as we burn fossil fuels, far, far worse is on the way; and I take zero satisfaction in knowing that this will be proven right, too, with a certainty as non-negotiable and merciless as the physics behind fossil-fueled global heating,\" Kalmus writes, injecting as much fear rhetoric as he can to get his point across.\n\n\"Instead, I only feel fury at those in power, and bottomless grief for all that I love. We are losing Earth on our watch.\"\n\nThe weather has been so warm lately – it is summer, after all – that Kalmus fears the Amazon rainforest \"may already be past its tipping point.\" He also worries that coral reefs \"will be gone from our planet by mid-century, and possibly much earlier given this surge in sea-surface temperatures.\"\n\n\"These are cosmic losses,\" Kalmus further whines. \"And as a father, I grieve for my children.\"\n\nKalmus again mentions fossil fuels in his piece, blaming them entirely for \"causing this damage\" that he believes includes a \"heat nightmare.\" And no amount of \"tree planting, recycling, carbon offsetting, or wishful carbon-capture thinking\" is ever going to fix the problem he imagines in his head about the current overheated state of the planet.\n\n\"The longer we allow the fossil fuel industry to exist, the more irreversible damage to Earth the people who profit from it will continue to knowingly cause,\" he further writes.\n\n\"We are careening toward fossil-fueled heatwaves that will kill over a million people in single events. And it will not plateau there: more fossil fuels, more heat, more death. The only way out is to end fossil fuels.\"\n\nOne wonders if Kalmus is one of those slow-walking, zombie-like \"stop oil\" goofballs in the orange vests who are stopping traffic during rush hour while they creep slowly through the streets of the UK in protest of oil.\n\nBecause he is a \"scientist,\" Kalmus thinks everyone should listen to whatever he has to say and obey.

        "text": "Joe Biden’s Climate Policies Weaken The U.S. And Strengthen China \n\n President Biden’s commitment to end fossil fuels has been ineffective in reducing the demand for oil – but very effective in both weakening the U.S. and empowering our primary global adversary, China. Assuming that a reduction in global carbon emissions is necessary to fight “climate change” (a disputed proposition ), it nonetheless makes little sense environmentally, economically, or strategically to hobble the American fossil fuel sector (cancelling pipelines, discouraging financing, restricting leases, and slow walking permits) before sufficient sources of renewable energy with a proven capacity to meet global demand can be demonstrated. \n\nIn its World Energy Outlook 2022 , even the International Energy Agency (IEA) warned that if the supply of oil “were to transition faster than demand, with a drop in fossil fuel investment preceding a surge in clean technologies, this would lead to much higher prices – possibly for a prolonged period.” The IEA’s warning had the advantage of being written after the war in Ukraine threatened worldwide energy supplies, which, more effectively than any desk-top research, demonstrated the global economic threat posed by a too-rapid retreat from fossil fuels. Worldwide demand for crude oil is currently forecast to hit an all-time high in 2023. China’s demand, in particular, is surging. In May, the IEA “revised up” its forecast for growth in global demand, with “China accounting for nearly 60% of global growth in 2023.” In the U.S., 79% of energy consumption comes from fossil fuels, while 13% comes from renewable energy sources, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). That’s after tens of billions of dollars in government spending in support of renewables, particularly wind and solar, which combined account for a mere 5% of our energy consumption. The bottom line: so-called renewables are insufficient – and lack the necessary dependability – to meet our energy needs. Despite this heavy fossil fuel dependence, over the past two decades carbon dioxide emissions in the U.S. have declined by 15% while China’s have grown by 216%, according to the EIA . The U.S. emissions reductions were due, in great part, to an increase in the use of inexpensive and clean-burning natural gas, which, thanks to fracking, the U.S. has and can produce in abundance. If the goal is actually to reduce global carbon emissions without causing global economic chaos, increased use of dependable and abundant American natural gas makes far more sense than curtailing U.S. production and spending billions on unreliable and expensive “renewable” energy sources. \n\nLet’s face it, if renewables were economically viable, dependable, and available in sufficient supply, the Chinese would be using them. In fact, they have every incentive to do so. Most of the processing of the minerals needed for electric-vehicle batteries happens in China. Using wind, solar, and batteries for energy production and transportation requires significantly more metals (three times more copper, seven times more rare earths, 19 times more nickel, 25 times more graphite, and 42 times more lithium) than natural gas, oil, or coal production and transportation. The U.S. mines and processes a negligible amount of these metals, which primarily come from countries such as Australia, China, Congo, and Indonesia. Notably, 60% of rare earths are mined in China. Chemical processing, battery components, and assembly are mostly done by Chinese companies. China also processes 87% of rare earths, 65% of cobalt, 58% of lithium, and 40% of copper. As a result, China’s economy has benefitted significantly from the global push toward renewable energy . Of the 12.7 million jobs worldwide related to renewable energy, 5.4 million jobs are in China, 0.9 million in the U.S., and 1.2 million in Europe. Of the worldwide jobs related to solar energy manufacturing, 68% are in China, as are 48% of jobs related to wind power. \n\nTo further reduce U.S. carbon emissions, the Biden administration proposes spending hundreds of billions to increase our dependence on unreliable wind and solar power. This plan is set forth in the so-called Inflation Reduction Act , a green energy bill that does virtually nothing to reduce inflation. According to a summary of the act by Senate Democrats, the bill would “reduce carbon emissions by roughly 40% by 2030.” But there would be consequences. Using a clone of the Biden’s EIA’s energy model, a Heritage Foundation study found that reducing carbon dioxide emissions 44% by 2030 would cause 1.2 million in annual average job losses in the U.S. , plus an aggregate GDP loss of $7.7 trillion through 2040 – or $87,000 per family of four. Average household electricity expenses for American families would increase by 23%. All to replace reliable and abundant energy sources that have been reducing U.S. carbon dioxide emissions for two decades. Biden’s energy policies are needlessly weakening the U.S. and strengthening China. Since the 1970s, with the help of its innovative energy industry, America has won independence from OPEC. It makes no sense to implement policies that weaken our economy while once again putting our access to energy at the mercy of a",

        "text": "Full-Spectrum Psyop: US Whips Up Fear of Russian Bugaboo to ‘Subjugate Europe’ \n\nFrom the French president’s threats to send troops to Ukraine to a series of media reports on alleged Russian plans to invade NATO, anti-Russian hysteria has reached a fever pitch in European capitals. Meanwhile, one world power has been able to sit back and quietly collect the dividends, says veteran foreign affairs observer Gilbert Doctorow.\n\nEuropean politicians are doing their best to continue ratcheting up tensions with Moscow, with French President Emmanuel Macron reiterating that he may send thousands of troops to Ukraine, Baltic politicians allying with Paris on the issue, and Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski saying it’s an “open secret” that NATO soldiers are already in the country.\n\nBritish and German media have done their part to add fuel the hysteria, citing a recent briefing to Bundestag lawmakers on purported plans by Russia to kick off a “full-scale ‘land, sea and air’ war” with NATO.\n\n“We hear threats from the Kremlin almost every day…so we have to take into account that Vladimir Putin might even attack a NATO country one day,” German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius warned in an interview earlier this year.\n\nThis week, Polish President Andrzej Duda claimed it was a matter “of common sense” that “Putin, by putting his economy on a war footing, will have such military might that he will be able to attack NATO.” Meanwhile, his top general, Polish Armed Forces Chief of Staff Wieslaw Kukula, has alleged that Russia is actively “preparing for a conflict,” and urging Europe to do the same.\n\nEurope’s defenses are in an unenviable state. Facing a major economic downturn and a $61 billion spending shortfall after giving roughly the same amount away to Kiev for NATO’s proxy war against Russia, European military leaders have warned that they could be left “throwing stones” within hours of a major conflict breaking out as arms and ammo stocks round dry.\n\nBut the question no Western officials or media have been able to answer is why Russia – which has over the past three decades expressed a preference for economic cooperation with Europe, rather than fighting its western neighbors, would be interested in invading NATO and almost certainly triggering World War III.\n\n“The whole of NATO cannot fail to understand that Russia has no reason, no interest – neither geopolitical, nor economic, nor political, nor military – to fight with NATO countries,” President Putin said in an interview in December, emphasizing that Moscow and the bloc “have no territorial claims against each other” and could live peacefully.\n\nPuppet Hands at Play\n\nThe problem may just be that Russia is taking the hysterical outbursts by NATO officials and Western media at face value, instead of searching for the ‘man behind the curtain’ seeking desperately to keep tensions in place.\n\n“For the United States, the war in Ukraine has failed as a means of weakening Russia so that they can proceed with preparations to fight China. But it has succeeded spectacularly as a means of subjugating Europe. Washington now firmly has its knees on the neck of Europe,” veteran international relations and Russian affairs expert Dr. Gilbert Doctorow told Sputnik.\n\nEconomically and politically, the US has been able to extract major concessions from the Europeans over the past two years, plucking hundreds of manufacturers from the continent thanks to an energy crisis sparked by the bloc’s “suicidal” decision to cut off Russian energy supplies, forcing the EU to purchase American LNG at four times the cost, and even trying to saddle Brussels with economic and military aid to Ukraine as Congress remains deadlocked over a $61 billion aid package.\n\n“Here in Europe, the war is now being used to whip up popular enthusiasm for war mobilization of the domestic economies and subjugation of the populace to authoritarian and unlimited powers of the ruling elite,” Doctorow said.\n\n27 February 2024, 17:53 GMT\n\n“What remains of free speech and other freedoms can be snuffed out in war hysteria. Moreover, the war fever is being used by [European Commission President Ursula] von der Leyen and the EU Commission in a bid to draw more power into Brussels at the expense of the national governments,” Doctorow warned.\n\n“Some countries are resisting, for example Prime Minister [Mark] Rutte of the Netherlands and even the mealy-mouthed German Chancellor [Olaf Scholz, ed.] are publicly opposed to the proposal of a European debt issuance to finance subsidies to the military production companies, all in spite of van der Leyen. Meanwhile, Macron is on the other side, pushing for greater European centralization for which is the proposed common investment in defense is a nice instrument,” the observer added.\n\nPoking the Bear\n\nRussia’s military buildup “has been reactive to new challenges from the West,” Doctorow stressed, pointing out, for example, that “until the decision of Finland and Sweden to join NATO, Russia had almost no troops on its northwest border. Now, in response to new threats from the northern neighbors, that is being rectified by a big military build-up on the Russian side.”\n\nSomething similar can be said of defense budgets, with the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute recently estimating that Russia’s defense budget amounted to $65.9 billion in 2021 – a fraction of NATO spending of $1.16 trillion ($753.5 billion of that by the US alone) the same year. Even in 2024, with the proxy war with NATO in Ukraine raging and intensifying, Russia plans to spend the equivalent of $140 billion, still just a fraction of the Western bloc, which has again accounted for more than half of all military spending worldwide this year.\n\nUltimately, Dr. Doctorow emphasized, Western governments are following an old playbook.\n\n“An aggressive foreign policy stand is almost always a convenient way of distracting attention away from domestic failures. And thanks to the boomerang of Western sanctions, European economies are doing very poorly as we go into the June elections” to the European Parliament, the observer summed up.",

In recent months, US newspapers including The Washington Post, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal have reported that the US Central Intelligence Agency knew of a Ukrainian plot to attack the pipelines. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has denied Ukraine attacked them. “If we proceed from the proven complicity of Western countries in blowing up the Nord Streams, then we have no constraints - even moral - left to prevent us from destroying the ocean floor cable communications of our enemies,” Medvedev, a former Russian president who is now deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, said on Telegram. Sub-sea cables which criss-cross the world’s oceans have become the arteries of global communications. Their importance has made them the focus of growing geopolitical competition between China and Russia on the one side and the United States and its Western allies on the other. \n\nRussia has repeatedly said the West - and particularly the United States and Britain - was behind the Nord Stream blasts. The Kremlin has repeatedly said that the world should know the truth about what happened. Moscow has demanded an international investigation into the destruction of the pipelines, a Kremlin-designed project to circumvent Ukraine in exporting its gas under the Baltic Sea directly to western Europe. \n\n“It would be useful to think about the reasons for the stubborn unwillingness of the collective West to launch a transparent and objective international investigation under the auspices of the UN Security Council,” said Andrey Ledenev, minister-counsellor at the Russian embassy in Washington.

        "text": "CNN Peddles False Alarm About Western Antarctica Melting \n\nA recent article posted by CNN claims that western Antarctica is melting rapidly and can’t be stopped, due to human-caused global warming, which will result in a dangerous rise ocean levels. This is false. While the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) has seen more melting than other parts of the continent, it is due not to climate change but rather to localized temporary weather conditions and ongoing subsurface volcanic activity below the ice sheet. Indeed, outside of West Antarctica and the Antarctic peninsula, the larger part of the continent has gained ice mass in recent decades and has actually experienced a cooling trend.\n\nThe article, “Rapid melting in West Antarctica is ‘unavoidable,’ with potentially disastrous consequences for sea level rise, study finds,” says that West Antarctica’s ice shelves are melting rapidly, and probably can’t be stopped. CNN claims this will lead to “potentially devastating implications for sea level rise around the world,” citing a recent study in Nature Climate Change. The study’s authors claim that even if the world were to meet emissions and warming targets, like limiting warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial global average temperature, the WAIS will still experience “substantial ocean warming and ice shelf melting[.]”\n\nThe study’s authors considered most WAIS melting to be due to “basal melting,” due to warm ocean currents that heat the ice from below. It is notable that they do not consider subsurface geothermal heating from volcanic activity below the ice as a potential contributor, especially since several recent studies suggest that the WAIS, particularly around the Thwaites glacier, sits on top of a large number of subsurface volcanoes which are believed to be contributing to melting below the ice and localized increased water temperatures.\n\nThere is also a question as to whether or not Antarctica has seen much – if any – warming at all over the past 70 years, as discussed in the Climate Realism post “South Pole Warming Claims Contradicted by Actual Temperature Measurements.” According to NASA data, there was even some cooling between the early 2000s and 2019.\n\nBasal melting, then, really is the best explanation, but only appears to be occurring in the WAIS, because the rest of the continent has seen a gain in ice mass in its interior.\n\nSea ice itself melting cannot contribute to sea level rise, since it is already displacing water, but the Nature Climate Change study’s authors explain that the melt of the sea ice can cause land ice to shift forward and likewise melt into the warmer waters. This makes sense and likely occurs; but the recorded interior ice mass gain makes it unclear whether there is a net loss of ice for Antarctica as a whole, and if so, by how much and at what rate, making claims about rising seas extremely uncertain. Data contained in a recent study even shows that Antarctica has seen a small expansion of sea ice in total over the past seven decades, providing a compelling visual demonstration of the continent’s recent cooling trend. (See graphic below)\n\nIndeed, the authors of the Nature Climate Change study themselves admit that their modeling suggested “internal climate variability will be extremely important in determining the future of the WAIS.” Perhaps because this admitted uncertainty fails to advance the climate crisis narrative CNN consistently pushes, the news outlet did not quote from that portion of the study, and seemingly ignored its role in Antarctica’s net ice balance.\n\nIn the implications section, the authors explain that they only focused on a single ice-ocean model and a single climate model, in the process ignoring many other potential feedbacks. They also said that increased snowfall could actually offset sea level rise, which tracks with the ice mass gain in the interior as discussed. In any case, the study authors say adaptation should be a major focus when it comes to sea level rise over the next several centuries. Most notably, “[i]nternal climate variability, which we cannot predict or control, may be the deciding factor in the rate of ice loss during this time.”\n\nUsing only a single model, and including woefully flawed RCP8.5 scenario among those examined undercuts any confidence one might have in the accuracy of the study’s predictions.\n\nRegarding “dangerous” sea level rise, again Antarctica’s contributions are uncertain. If, as some studies show, the interior and eastern portions are gaining ice even as the WAIS suffers some melt, the continent may not contribute very much at all. The authors acknowledge this. Regardless, adaption to sea level rise is something that city planners and developers should take into account, because as discussed in Climate Realism here, here, and here, sea levels are rising in some areas, and if there is ice melt as the planet modestly warms, we can expect this trend to continue, albeit at a less alarming pace than some in the media would have us believe.",

Ukraine's leaders say revenues from Russia's energy exports are financing Moscow's destructive war on Ukraine and must be ended.\n\nThat won't be easy to do. The EU's 27 nations get around 40% of their natural gas from Russia and around 25% of their oil. Natural gas would be the most difficult do without, energy analysts say, since most of it comes by pipeline from Russia and supplies of liquefied gas, which can be ordered by ship, are limited amid strong demand worldwide.\n\nGermany, a major manufacturing hub and an importer of Russian gas, has so far resisted an immediate shut-off and said it plans to instead phase out Russian oil by the end of the year and most Russian gas imports by mid-2024. The EU's executive commission has outlined steps to cut the consumption of Russian gas by two-thirds by year's end through using more pipeline gas from Norway and Azerbaijan, importing more liqueifed gas, accelerating the deployment of wind and solar projects and intensifying conservation efforts.\n\nGerman Vice-Chancellor Robert Habeck said in an interview with the Funke media group that “an immediate gas embargo would endanger social peace in Germany.”\n\nDespite widespread economic sanctions against Russian banks and individuals, the EU continues to send around $850 million per day to Russia for oil and gas, even as EU governments condemn the war in Ukraine. Gas-intensive companies include producers of glass, metals, ceramics and chemicals.\n\nIndustry officials say in many cases natural gas would be impossible to replace in the short run, and associations representing food processing, metal galvanizing and glass companies as well as the head of the chemical industry union have also opposed a sudden shutoff of Russian gas imports.\n\nEnergy analysts say a complete Russian gas cutoff could cause a recession and put some EU governments in the position of having to ration gas. The government would decide which businesses are less essential and those would have their supply shut off or reduced to spare households and hospitals, who are protected by EU law. In any case, such a shutoff would send already high gas prices even higher.\n\nAnalysts say Russian crude oil would be easier to replace than gas for the EU but that a boycott would still lead to higher energy prices, hurting consumers who are already facing a record EU inflation of 7.5%.",

        "text": "With this one simple act, Russia could forever secure its territorial gains in Ukraine \n\n By now the world is all too depressingly familiar with Russian military doctrine, which permits the use of nuclear weapons against \"large-scale aggression utilizing conventional weapons in situations critical to the national security of the Russian Federation.” This barbaric philosophy of war means that\n\nVladimir Putin could simply announce Russia's annexation of its territorial gains in eastern and southern Ukraine, thus making the regions part of the Russian Federation. And should Ukraine persist in retaking those territories — see: Russian military doctrine. That Putin intends to legalize such an official, illegal land grab is \"likely\" within the next few months, writes the Institute for the Study of War. He would then quickly follow up with an announcement, either vague or specific, that the territories shall if necessary be defended by nuclear weapons. \n\nThis verbal gambit has so far intimidated the West into proceeding with extreme caution in its military assistance to Ukraine. Russian annexation could potentially convert caution into inertia. Which means Ukraine, with the West's military support, must act with the greatest urgency. Because for Putin, the matter of annexation is a question of timing. If he foresees additional territorial gains in eastern and southern Ukraine, he will postpone annexation, opting for the largest land grab possible. (This is the most likely of likelihoods.) But if he suspects his military is on the brink of collapse, or hopelessly stalemated, or gradually losing Ukrainian ground, that's when he would \"officially\" incorporate the territories he has into the Federation. \n\nNegotiations would become moot. Ukraine and the West would then face an awful dilemma: concede Russia's grossly illicit acquisitions, or risk a nuclear confrontation. Since both prospects are unacceptable to both non-Russian parties, only the third option of a massive Ukrainian counteroffensive is to be entertained. Russia's ground gains, east and south, must be erased, and they must be erased swiftly. As with Putin's decision on annexation, the timing of a Ukrainian counter-push is paramount; it must be executed before Russia can organize administrative centers in misappropriated territories and declare them parts of the Federation. \n\nAnnexation of such a broad swath of Ukrainian ground — from its southeast, its Azov Sea access, and all the way along its Black Sea coastline — would almost certainly suffocate the very existence of a Ukrainian state. Much of its agricultural ground and all of its sea-export access would be lost, its economy permanently ruptured, its national finances devastated. Moreover, millions of its citizens would be captives of a Stalinesque occupier — the stolen Ukrainian ground would become a kind of huge Gaza Strip. All of which means just one thing. \n\nThe West must immediately saturate Ukraine with the heaviest of armaments it can supply — which is one helluva lot; helicopters, armored personnel vehicles, tanks, and especially artillery. Every fighter jet the West can scrape up is strongly advised as well. Ukraine is indisputably capable of winning this war outright, and soon, if the West adequately supplies it and Ukraine immediately commences a counteroffensive in the lands Russia aims to illegally incorporate. \n\nBut of course an overwhelming offensive is impossible without overwhelming war matériel. The decision is the West's: either accept Vladimir Putin's barbarous thievery as a fait accompli, or arm Ukraine to the teeth — now.",

Urea is the chief nitrogenous end-product of the metabolic breakdown of proteins in all mammals and some fish.

        "text": "How Green Fanaticism and the Sanctions Regime Destroyed the German Economy \n\n The German economy, the fourth-largest in the world, has ground to a standstill. There is no growth. Manufacturing is depressed, trade is weak, inflation is high, and jobs are scarce. Germany is now the sick man of Europe, and misguided energy policy is largely to blame.\n\nGermany has just recorded its third consecutive quarter of recession, marked by negative gross domestic product (GDP) growth. The central bank expects the rest of the year to be no better. Germany has recently experienced its highest rate of inflation in a quarter of a century. German inflation, among the highest in Europe, remained stubbornly high at 6.2 percent in July, compared with 5.3 percent for the eurozone as a whole. This despite the fact that German manufacturing is facing “its sharpest slump ... since May 2020”—that is, when the entire world was locked down.\n\nWhat President Donald Trump was referring to in 2018 was Germany’s increasing dependence on Russian gas, which in turn resulted from “green” energy policies implemented over the previous decade. These near-sighted and self-sabotaging policies effectively destroyed Germany’s highly efficient and inexpensive domestic energy production capacity derived from world-class coal and nuclear power. Before this decade of folly, Germany’s coal plants were among the most modern and efficient in the world. Low-carbon nuclear energy produced a substantial portion of Germany’s power needs. But all of this was forsaken in the quixotic pursuit of a utopian vision of zero-carbon green energy.\n\nImport of Russian gas thus became essential to the German economy. Germany imported more than 1.7 trillion cubic tons of gas from Russia in 2021, constituting nearly half of its total gas usage that year. As a result of the Russia–Ukraine war, the sanctions regime imposed on Russia by the United States and the West, and the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, Germany has been forced to find alternative sources of emergency fuel stock to keep its lights on and its citizens from freezing.\n\nAs a result, Germany’s electricity prices are now among the highest on the planet. The only countries paying more per kilowatt hour anywhere in the world are Denmark and Italy. Along with Germany, Italy’s energy supply was most affected by the disruption of Russian gas. Overall, those European nations that relied most heavily on Russian gas are paying more for electricity than other countries and suffering worse inflation as a result.\n\nFor background, coal had been essential to German energy and thus to the economy as a whole. But facing intense pressure from green politicians and evangelists of a looming climate apocalypse, Germany embarked on a plan to completely eliminate coal and other fossil fuels from its energy complex. This despite the fact that Germany’s consumption of coal was relatively minor as a portion of global totals—according to the International Energy Agency, China, India, and Southeast Asia consume three-quarters of global coal—and the coal was processed with much less of an effect on the environment.\n\nGermany reversed course on coal in 2022, as the geopolitical crisis forced “energy security to trump climate goals.”\n\nDecommissioned plants were reactivated, and plans to mothball others were postponed. Germany consumed more than 8 billion tons of coal in 2022, up by 19 percent from 2021. Despite the increase and because of the efficiency of German production, carbon emissions near the end of 2022 were nonetheless at their lowest level in 30 years.\n\nThe German government’s position is that this increased use of coal was “a last resort and short-term backup to secure energy supply” amid the emergency. Despite the stark reality on the ground, the nation’s leaders say they remain committed to eliminate coal by 2030 as part of their long-term objective to achieve “net-zero emissions.”\n\nNuclear Could Have Saved GermanyAt its peak, Germany had 36 nuclear reactors capable of producing 26,375 Mwe (Megawatts electric) of low-carbon power annually. Under political pressure from anti-nuclear factions, by 2011, only 17 reactors remained. But even still, Germany obtained one-quarter of its electricity consumption from nuclear power. As a result of the Green Party’s relentless opposition, supported by environmental activists, and then the anti-nuclear fear-mongering that prevailed following Japan’s Fukushima nuclear reactor accident in 2011, all but a handful of Germany’s remaining reactors were promptly shut down.\n\nVirtue-Signaling Straight Into the AbyssAccording to ClimateWatch, just three countries—China, India, and the United States—produce 42.6 percent of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. On the other hand, Germany produces 1.75 percent of global GHG emissions. A 25 percent reduction in Germany’s emissions—devastating to German GDP—would bring the proportion down to 1.3 percent of global GHG emissions.\n\nSo, in other words, Germany’s leaders have been willing to bankrupt its economy, impoverish its people, and plunge the nation into darkness for a rounding error. While German leadership virtue signals their way to perdition, China and other countries have been unapologetic in their intentions to increase GHG emissions as their economies grow.\n\nThe proposed solution of German leaders has been for its citizens to consume less and its factories to produce less or move manufacturing offshore. But why should the German people suffer for the idiocy of their leaders? Why should German industry be sacrificed to benefit other economies at the expense of their own?\n\nGermany’s beleaguered citizens appear to have had enough of this disaster. Political change is in the winds. The populist conservative party, Alternative for Germany, has just emerged as Germany’s second strongest party, polling at 20 percent support nationwide and more than one-third in some regions. One of the party’s main selling points is that it’s “an aggressive opponent of the government’s energy and climate policy.”\n\nPerhaps it isn’t too late for Germany after all.",

One can adapt to the taste and it is said that over time it will taste even better. “Over time, the additional cost will be minimal and people’s behavior could be changed through regulations.”\n\nIt is reported that the co-founder of Microsoft has acquired hundreds of thousands of acres of American farmland, raising concerns. When asked about it earlier this year, he responded:\n\n“I own less than 1/4000 of the farmland in the U.S. I have invested in these farms to increase their productivity and create more jobs. There is no grand plan behind it; in fact, all of these decisions are made by a professional investment team.”\n\n— Bill Gates\n\nBruner maintains that Gates is not only buying land, but also groundwater rights.\n\n“In addition to acquiring land (and irrigation rights) and fertilizers, Gates has been pursuing significant interests in water and water treatment, aspects crucial to controlling the agricultural industry,” he argues.\n\nBruner mentioned to Fox News Digital:\n\n“First there were patented seeds and fertilizers, now they are patenting alternatives to meat. Banning livestock farming would give effective monopolies to alternative protein companies, benefiting investors like Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg and even BlackRock. Substitute meats serve to control the food market, not to save the planet.”\n\nAs expected, the Gates Foundation has not responded on this issue.",

        "text": "Climate BS from the Wall Street Journal \n\n Climate BS from the Wall Street Journal\n\nMy publisher contacted me this week, drawing attention to a Wall Street Journal article claiming climate change is producing shortages of “the finer things in life,” like wine, coffee, cocoa, and olive oil. The implication was clear: your carbon footprint is causing the price of these commodities to sharply rise.\n\n“Total bull-bleep,” I replied.\n\nSpecifically, the story speaks of the recent drought in West Africa, which has resulted in a cocoa shortage; dry spells in Vietnam, which have reduced coffee harvests; and parched Italian olive groves and grape vineyards recently destroyed by wildfires.\n\nNone of these meteorological events has anything to do with the use of fossil fuels and the subsequent release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The truth is that these regions of the world are historically well known for witnessing wild swings in otherwise natural weather patterns.\n\nAs I explain repeatedly in my new book Climate Cult: Exposing and Defeating Their War on Life, Liberty, and Property, such misinformation feeds into an elaborate propaganda campaign designed to frighten the developed world into demanding a carbon-neutral energy grid that would be about as reliable North Korea’s.\n\nLet’s begin with West Africa, where the climate periodically exhibits large spatial and temporal variabilities that allow for recurrent droughts, some lasting hundreds of years. In fact, the past couple years of dry weather pales in comparison to the West African droughts in the 1970s and 80s. As for the cocoa production, a reality missing from the discussion is that global consumers are demanding more cocoa than ever, so a blip in production impacts retail price and availability like never before.\n\nThe recent drought in Vietnam is quite serious, but I’m happy to report it’s not being caused by your SUV. While the lack of rain in parts of Southeast Asia is the worst since the 1930s (a decade which remains the hottest on record throughout much of the world), the drought is associated with an El Nino weather pattern. El Nino, and its sister La Nina, are ancient occurrences that possess the dynamics to both enhance or diminish precipitation, depending on a variety of quite ordinary atmospheric circumstances.\n\nWildfires feeding on extremely dry vegetation have certainly taken a recent toll on olive groves in Italy and drought has impacted wine production there as well. The journal Nature recently published a study, claiming, “Climate change is affecting grape yield, composition and wine quality. As a result, the geography of wine production is changing.” However, the publication’s editorial bias seems to have caused them to ignore the historical record. The worst drought in modern Italy occurred in the 1920s. However, going back further, that region’s most catastrophic precipitation deficiency began in the 1530s and lasted the better part of a decade. It was so extreme that Protestant reformer Martin Luther wondered if it was a sign of the end times. Clergy in Germany, Italy, and England urged the people to beg God for forgiveness and pray for the deliverance of rain.\n\nAs I explain in my book, those pushing the climate agenda employ ad hominem arguments that appeal to raw emotions rather than intellect. And, as I also detail, those on the left aren’t fond of examining history. For them, Karl Marx stated it best in his 1844 book, The Holy Family: “History does nothing; it possesses no immense wealth; it wages no battles.”",

        "text": "Norway Accused of 'Profiting Indecently’ From Energy Crisis Pummeling Europe \n\n As Europeans shudder at the mere thought of their household energy bills looming this winter, one of the continent’s richest countries - Norway - has been getting richer by the day.Norway's oil and gas sector has seen record profits, with the government's Statistics Norway bureau saying that revenues from the country's natural gas exports reached Nkr128Bln ($13Bln) in July, 332.7 percent higher than in the same month last year.\n\nSurging energy costs and inflation rates across the continent have been exacerbated by the decision of Brussels officials and individual countries to stop buying Russian oil, gas and coal as part of their sanctions against Moscow for its military operation in Ukraine.The EU obtained as much as 40 percent of its gas from Russia before the Ukraine crisis. Norway - Europe’s most important supplier of gas, at present covers around a quarter of the total gas consumption in the EU and Great Britain.\n\n‘Embarrassingly’ RicherThe Scandinavian country has been profiting from the situation and growing \"embarrassingly\" richer, a report in The Economist claims.Supplying energy to Europe has always been tremendously lucrative for Norway. However, after Brussels and individual European countries unleashed attempts to curb Russia's energy exports to Europe, the ensuing power crunch sent huge sums flowing north, the publication reports. Norway is now forced to fend off charges of \"war profiteering\", the outlet claimed.In a typical year, sales of oil, gas and electricity bring in more than $50Bln, or $10,000 per Norwegian, according to the report.The volatile situation - triggered in a large part by self-harming restrictions on Russia - has caused Norway’s energy-export revenues to shoot up to approximately $200Bln a year, the report pointed out.Norway has boosted gas output as much as possible, with the government even imposing a forced settlement in a dispute between striking offshore oil and gas workers and energy executives earlier this summer. \n\nEquinor, Norway's largest gas producer and the second-largest in Europe, initiated a safe shutdown of three oil fields because of the strike in July, with the Norwegian Oil and Gas Association warning at the time that an extension of the strike could affect almost 60 percent of gas exports.Norway also funneled money to support Ukraine, with the government proposing to allocate roughly 1Bln euros (Nkr10Bln; $1Bln) to be distributed over 2022 and 2023, as funding for humanitarian assistance and budget support. Despite Norway also joining the sanctions imposed on Russia by the EU, the mood towards the country has soured as the energy crisis has worsened, according to the report.\n\n‘Indirect Preying’\nAs consumers and businesses struggle with soaring costs, Europe is starting to grumble. Poland’s Prime Minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, was the first to voice his anger, asking why his country should be “paying Norway gigantic money for gas\".Others have been more circumspect, especially as Norway continues to insist that the present market pricing for gas should remain in place.On 2 September, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that the EU might limit the price of Russian natural gas after G7 finance ministers confirmed their intention to impose price caps on Russian oil as part of the expanded sanctions against Moscow. However, the EU’s energy ministers failed to reach a consensus, with member states which import large amounts of gas from Russia - including Hungary, Slovakia and Austria - speaking out against it.Russia slammed the idea of imposing a price cap on its oil, warning that it would lead to a rise in prices.\n\nOn 12 September, Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store and President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen spoke on the telephone about the energy crisis affecting Europe.He invited Norway-based gas producers to discuss the possibility of providing more long-term contracts.The longer gas prices stay high, the more Norway will come under pressure to “share” some of its windfall with Europe, Georg Riekeles of the European Policy Centre think-tank was cited as saying.",

Alekandr Dugin is regarded by the West as Putin's Rasputin, and it matters little that he is not: NATO, Washington, are convinced otherwise, and that was enough to decree his death.\n\nAttempts to kill philosophers, journalists, bloggers, actors and writers, all people accumulated by love for their country, sadly recall the assassination of Italian philosopher Giovanni Gentile executed on April 15, 1944. Gentile was sentenced to death by the Americans for an article of his in which he incited resistance against the barbarians who landed in Sicily: his murderers were communist partisans, greedy contractors of overseas desires.\n\nInstinctively we feel that journalists, bloggers, actors and writers, all people accumulated by the love for their country, should be as if suspended in a middle ground, and not become priority targets of a scum that cannot aim any further.\n\nPrecisely because they are intellectuals and not military leaders, their words should be able to circulate freely in wartime too, without their lives being endangered.\n\nWe recognize the naivete of such an idea, especially now that the Kiev \"counteroffensive” is showing all its inevitable and predictable limitations and especially its impossibility of success. Now that the former Kiev comedian, the one who can play a piano with his penis and has a marked preference for cocaine, has managed to turn the entire fighting front into a human meat grinder where his countrymen are sent to slaughter, we now expect indeed an increase in similar cowardice.\n\nItalian artist Jorit is also in the crosshairs: having painted a mural in Mariupol dedicated to the children of the Donbass earned him a place on Myrotvorec', the death list of \"enemies of Ukraine.” Did anyone happen to hear the Italian government protest? Has the Ukrainian ambassador been summoned by Giorgia Meloni's government?\n\nWe thank Jorit for his commitment and sensitivity and express to Margarita Simonyan and Ksenia Sobchak all our solidarity and affection for the escaped danger. This time it went well and Russian intelligence managed to save two lives by acting in time.\n\nAs far as we are concerned, the war can end only one way: with Moscow's victory and the defeat of Washington's and NATO's plans, so that once Ukraine is liberated, Europe can be too.\n\nUS President-elect Donald Trump does not intend to make concessions to Russian leader Vladimir Putin, Trump's special envoy to Ukraine Keith Kellogg said.",

        "text": "Data Refutes Media’s ‘Attribution’ Con That Climate Change Boosted Dubai’s Rainfall \n\n A few media outlets, including CNN and BBC, have run recent articles talking about flooding in Dubai, claiming that climate change made the storms worse. This is false. [emphasis, links added]\n\nThere is no evidence that climate change made the rain more extreme, instead, evidence indicates that El Niño and even cloud-seeding may have contributed.\n\nBoth the BBC’s article, “Deadly Dubai floods made worse by climate change,” and the one posted by CNN, “Scientists find the fingerprints of climate change on Dubai’s deadly floods,” reference a study done by the World Weather Attribution (WWA) group, which claimed that climate change made the rain events 10 to 40 percent more intense than if global warming was not occurring.\n\nCNN’s writer says global warming is the likely driver of heavy rainfall in Dubai “because the atmosphere in a 1.2-degree warmer world can now hold 8.4% more moisture, which is making extreme rain events more intense.”\n\nThese claims are nonsense, and worse, non-scientific, for the simple reason that not only does data not show that heavy rainfall is becoming more intense or common, but the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) doesn’t even claim that any sign whatsoever will even begin to emerge, according to their own projections, until well into the future.\n\nAs discussed by meteorologist Anthony Watts in a previous Climate Realism post on the extreme rain in Dubai, the latest claims from the IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report show that “heavy precipitation and pluvial flooding” has not yet emerged in the current “historical period.”\n\nThey have found no climate signal related to heavy rain. (See figure below)\n\nEven if there was a climate signal in the broader data, the modeling done by WWA does not reflect real-world conditions and actually proves nothing at all.\n\nAgain, several previous posts at Climate Realism (here, here, and here, as samples) have discussed in detail the issues with weather attribution “science.”\n\nThe best description of how these attribution studies work was given by statistician Dr. William Briggs in a paper compiled by the Global Warming Policy Foundation. Dr. Briggs wrote:\n\nAll attribution studies work around the same basic theme. … A model of the climate as it does not exist, but which is claimed to represent what the climate would look like had mankind not ‘interfered’ with it, is run many times. The outputs from these runs is examined for some ‘bad’ or ‘extreme’ event, such as higher temperatures or increased numbers of hurricanes making landfall, or rainfall exceeding some amount. The frequency with which these bad events occur in the model is noted. Next, a model of the climate as it is said to now exist is run many times. This model represents global warming. The frequencies from the same bad events in the model are again noted. The frequencies between the models are then compared. If the model of the current climate has a greater frequency of the bad event than the imaginary (called ‘counterfactual’) climate, the event is said to be caused by global warming, in whole or in part.\n\nFundamentally, attribution science cannot be proof of human influences on the weather via climate change because it begins with the assumption that any given weather event is being influenced by climate change.\n\nIn other words, the model is designed with the outcome in mind, making it impossible for them to “discover” anything to the contrary.\n\nIn WWA’s rapidly produced attribution studies the question is never whether climate change contributed to a particular extreme weather event, but rather only, how much additional ferocity it caused.\n\nThe WWA models cannot prove that the heavy rain in Dubai, and the resultant flooding, was caused by climate change at all, much less attribute a particular percentage of the rain to climate change.\n\nBoth the BBC and CNN grudgingly acknowledge but play down the role El Niño had in the storms and flooding, even though it is much more likely to be a contributing factor for the heavy rainfall than long-term climate change.\n\nEl Niño has a significant influence on weather patterns around the world, including the United Arab Emirates. A 2016 study found that El Niño has been associated with extreme rainfall in UAE during multiple years, going back to 1982.\n\nAlthough recent reports have seen the government backpedaling on this claim, when the flood stories first broke, a UAE National Center of Meteorology scientist admitted to Bloomberg that cloud-seeding experiments were being run in the days leading up to the storms. This may also have played a role.\n\nRemarkably, journalists continue to fall for the attribution modeling con, assuming they are seeking the truth when it comes to the impact of the modest warming of the past century.\n\nHowever, if these journalists are instead intended to act as just a mouthpiece for weather attribution propaganda in furtherance of the climate crisis narrative, then they are guilty of knowingly deceiving their audiences who may lack the background knowledge allowing them to recognize that attribution modeling, as currently practiced, is unscientific.\n\nIn either case, the BBC and CNN are misleading their readers.",

        "text": "Biden Proposes to Export 20 Million Tons of Ukrainian Grain to Stabilize Food Prices \n\n Biden Proposes to Export 20 Million Tons of Ukrainian Grain to Stabilize Food Prices\n\nAs the establishment in the United States continues to blame Russia for all its problems, including the mythical ”Putin’s price hike”, which started at least a year before Russia’s special military operation in Ukraine, there is a food shortage crisis looming over the world. And once again, the political West is pointing fingers at Russia. The reasons for the food shortage the world will almost certainly experience this year are manifold. The most obvious reason is that countries are limiting or outright banning food exports amid announced shortages, as they are trying to prevent food crises from affecting their populations.\n\nWestern mainstream media are also claiming that Russia’s special military operation in Ukraine is supposedly causing a food shortage in the country. Some media are going as far as to claim that Russia is allegedly “stealing” stored grain and agricultural machinery from Ukrainian farmers in areas such as the Kherson oblast (region). Why exactly would Russia be doing this is quite unclear, especially given the country’s massive surge in wheat and grain production in general, which is breaking records year by year and is set to reach a staggering 130 million tons this year.\n\nIn a piece published last week, Financial Times accused Russia “of industrial-scale farm plunder in Ukraine” and even claimed that this was “history repeating itself” by evoking memories of historic famine, referring to the 1930s Holodomor, which in recent years has been falsely portrayed as a sort of anti-Ukrainian “genocide” perpetrated by Russia, despite overwhelming evidence that the horrific famine caused as much damage in present-day southern Russia, reaching as far as western areas of modern-day Kazakhstan.\n\n“Ukraine’s government has accused Russia of trying to destroy its agriculture sector by stealing valuable grain stocks and machinery, deliberately bombing farms and warehouses and blockading its Black Sea ports to deprive it of exports earnings and farmers of liquidity. There are multiple examples around the country of grain elevators and warehouses being bombarded,” Financial Times claimed.\n\nThe accusations have multiple inconsistencies, including the idea that Ukraine cannot export grain due to Russia’s alleged naval blockade, when, in fact, it was the Kiev regime that indiscriminately placed naval mines in Odessa and other ports, making any form of naval transportation impossible and even endangering other major Black Sea ports as the mines drifted as far as the Bosphorus, over 600 km to the south. Also, if there is a food shortage, why would Ukraine even make such a suicidal move by exporting grain, when it can’t even feed its own population?\n\n“But it is the confiscation of grain in territories controlled by Moscow that is the most emotive issue. It has drawn parallels with the Soviet policy of crop confiscations coupled with the confinement of peasants to their villages in the 1930s. Some 4mn people died in the ensuing famine in Ukraine, known as the Holodomor, or death by starvation. After Russia bombed a farm business in Luhansk in eastern Ukraine last month, destroying machinery, buildings and 17,000 tonnes of wheat — a year’s supply for 300,000 people — Serhiy Haidai, the local governor, said on social media that Moscow was seeking ‘to organise the Holodomor in the Luhansk region, that is without a doubt’,” FT report added.\n\nAgain, the accusations are completely unsupported by any actual evidence on the ground. Lugansk oblast (region) is almost entirely under the control of the Lugansk People’s Republic, which only confirms that the Kiev regime has no reliable information from the area. And given the regime’s track record when it comes to the veracity of its claims, the report should be taken with a grain of salt. The report went on to claim that Russia was allegedly trying to “use the 500,000 tons of grain it confiscated from Ukraine to blackmail countries experiencing food shortages”. The idea that a country which produced nearly 130 million tons of grain in 2021 alone needs half a million tons of Ukrainian grain to “blackmail” anyone is simply ridiculous.\n\nSo, again, why would Russia want to confiscate grain from Ukraine? Or is this just projection on the part of the political West? Well, it seems the US president Joe Biden inadvertently gave the answer to that. US president Joe Biden says the coming shortages and the ensuing global food crisis could be resolved if over 20 million tons of Ukrainian grain is exported from the country. The suggestion is rather confusing, as the Western mainstream media are claiming that Ukraine is on a verge of another Holodomor as the “evil” Russians are allegedly taking all of Ukraine’s grain. In essence, the political West is saying that to “save” Ukraine from hunger, they need to take its food away. In other words, to deal with a problem, we need to exacerbate it exponentially. A rather interesting train of thought.",

How are we going to “save the planet?”\n\nBut are any of the claims about the “climate crisis” and climate “science” even true?\n\nDoes CO2 Really Cause Rising Temperatures?Rising–and falling–CO2 levels are nothing new. In fact, they’ve been much higher than they are today. Furthermore, there is no epochal correlation or even causation between CO2 levels and higher average global temperatures.\n\n“The record is clear that the world has been warming since about the year 1700, 150 years before we were using fossil fuels,“ Moore said. ”1700 was the peak of the Little Ice Age, which was very cold and caused crop failures and starvation. Before that, around 1000 A.D. was the Medieval Warm Period, when Vikings farmed Greenland. [And] before that, around 500 A.D. were the Dark Ages, and before that, the Roman Warm Period when it was warmer than today, and the sea level was 1–2 meters higher than today.”\n\nMore CO2, More Food and OxygenThe reality is that CO2 is actually good for the planet in all sorts of ways, especially when it comes to solving food shortages, says Dr. Craig Idso, chairman of the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change.\n\nIn fact, the more humans there are, the more farm animals will be needed, and the more CO2 will be produced, leading to more oxygen-producing plants—and more food from those plants and animals will be the result.\n\nEVs Are Killing the Planet–and Our Power GridsAs for EVs, the drive to obtain lithium, which is critical for EV batteries, is destroying the environment at an alarming rate. Lithium mining is destroying fertile land, depleting water tables, poisoning the surrounding areas, killing wildlife, actually increasing CO2 levels, and causing other environmental damage at an alarming rate.\n\nEVs also strain our electrical grids and cost a fortune. And yet, gasoline-powered cars are being phased out. It’s almost as if someone doesn’t want regular people to have their own transportation.\n\nThe climate change myth is just that—a myth. It does the very thing it purports to prevent and replaces the Creator with the created. It’s a wicked lie that’s layered upon many other lies and suffused with a toxic religiosity evangelized by a thin stratum of inhumanity known as the global elite, who gather with their private jets and decide, over filet mignon, how much they’ll take away from the rest of us and how they'll funnel power to the state.\n\nA Planet Designed for HumanityBut humanity isn’t what’s wrong with the planet.\n\nIn fact, one could say that Earth is remarkably unique and was specifically made for human beings to live and to thrive. The biblical edict to “be fruitful and multiply” seems a lot wiser, healthier, and much more enjoyable than lithium mining and eating bugs.\n\nThat’s because it is.",

        "text": "‘Absolute Genius’: How Three Alarmist Billionaires Bankrolled The Fake Climate Catastrophe \n\n Do you think that the constant catastrophizing of weather and climate in the mainstream media, politics, and science has just appeared by accident? [emphasis, links added]\n\nOver the last few years, the BBC and the Guardian, [working] as of one mind, decided to float improbable ‘tipping point’ scares under cover of ‘scientists say’, while UN officials concluded that we had two years to save a ‘boiling’ planet and the ubiquitous ‘Jim’ Dale has been given free rein to make it up as he goes along on Talk TV and GB News.\n\nOf course, all this didn’t suddenly happen.\n\nEach of these examples is a testament to an extraordinary corruption of the true scientific process – an “amazing tale” according to political science writer Roger Pielke Jr., “a story of how wealth and power sought to shape climate science in pursuit of political goals.”\n\nThe main culprit in this amazing tale will not be unknown to regular readers of the Daily Sceptic and it is the improbable scenario of RCP8.5.\n\nThis has been promoted as a ‘business as usual’ set of scientific, economic, and societal assumptions and it suggests a temperature rise of up to 4°C in less than 80 years.\n\nAlthough downgraded by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change of late as “low likelihood”, it is still estimated to be behind about 50% of the climate-modeled ‘impacts’ highlighted over the entire scientific literature.\n\nAlmost all the claims of climate Armageddon and economic disaster peddled by those identified in our first paragraph are based on RCP8.5 input.\n\nIt is a tale of how three wealthy men bankrolled a project to promote an extreme scenario to guarantee that the economic impact of climate change they projected into the future would be “eye-poppingly large.”\n\nIt will also not be a surprise to learn that the billionaire green activist Michael Bloomberg has played a key role over the last decade in lifting this implausible pathway to underserved prominence.\n\nNotes Pielke: “It’s a story of privilege and conceit – the privilege in American democracy that accompanies being mindbogglingly wealthy, and the conceit that climate policies can best be pursued by corrupting the scientific literature on climate change.”\n\nIn 2012, three wealthy men, Bloomberg, hedge fund manager Tom Steyer, and former CEO of Goldman Sachs Hank Paulson chipped in $500,000 each to fund a project “making the climate threat feel real, immediate and potentially devastating to the business world.”\n\nAn early funded report was part-titled ‘Risky Business’ and it focused on RCP8.5 “as the pathway closest to a business-as-usual trajectory”. The pathway was said to be “closest to a future without concerted action to reduce future warming.”\n\nIn Pielke’s view, the authors of the ‘Risky Business’ report made two significant methodological mistakes. They characterized the extreme RCP8.5 scenario as ‘business as usual’ and suggested the world could move from one scenario to another.\n\nAs Pielke notes, the four different scenarios are independent with, for instance, RCP2.5 assuming a world with three billion people fewer than RCP8.5.\n\nBoth of the mistaken methodological choices were said to be contrary to the appropriate use set by the people who created them.\n\nThe “genius” of ‘Risky Business’ was it undertook a “sophisticated campaign” to introduce its methodological ideas into the mainstream scientific literature, “where they would take on a life of their own”.\n\nIn 2016, a paper from the ‘Risky Business’ project was published in the prestigious journal Science featuring the erroneous notion of moving from one RCP scenario to another.\n\nDespite the obvious methodological flaw, notes Pielke, the paper passed peer review with little or no criticism, and to date has been cited more than 1,100 times.\n\n“Hundreds, maybe thousands of papers followed similarly in adopting the same assumption of moving between incommensurate scenarios”, observes Pielke.\n\nA year later, Science published another study from ‘Risky Business’ with the bizarre suggestion that the United States would see a 10% hit to its economy under the most extreme version of RCP8.5, with an incredible 8°C rise in temperatures by the end of the century.\n\nThis prominent paper has been cited more than 1,100 times in other studies and, noted Piekle, the 10% GDP loss would become the top-line conclusion of the U.S. National Climate Assessment the very next year.\n\n“Publishing papers in the academic literature based on the flawed ‘Risky Business’ methods was a formula that would be repeated time and time again. Like the introduction of a virus, the misleading reinterpretation of climate scenarios expanded throughout climate science,” states Pielke.\n\nThe work begun by Bloomberg-Steyer-Paulson was subsequently taken up by a group called Climate Impact Lab, a collaboration of ‘Risky Business’ leaders and several universities.\n\nAccording to Pielke, Climate Impact Lab has thrived on using RCP8.5 to generate a steady series of media-friendly studies projecting extreme climate impacts.\n\nAmong them are stories suggesting rising sea levels could swamp major cities and displace almost 200 million people, while a rise in climate-related deaths will surpass all infectious diseases.\n\nAll backed, of course, by ‘scientists say’.\n\nPielke concludes that there is no hidden conspiracy – “all of this is taking place in plain sight”.\n\nThe political advocacy was “absolute genius” – a well-funded effort to fundamentally change how climate science was reported in the media, and ultimately how political discussion and policy options are shaped.\n\n“This effort has been phenomenally successful,” says Pielke – or as we might put it, the complete Dale-ification of most climate and net zero debate has been achieved.",

The UN assertion that climate change is caused by humans generating CO2 emissions has received serious challenges. The real environmental intelligentsia of the world such as, for example, the Climate Intelligence Foundation(CLINTEL) made up of a number of scientists know that the carbon-based claim is untrue. They have produced a World Climate Declaration which now comprises well over 1800 signatories declaring that currently, “There is no climate emergency.” These scientists know, however, that Earth’s long-term history indicates a pattern: This long-term pattern stretching over hundreds of thousands of years shows significant warming and cooling cycles. These periodic cycles have been known to cause significant rises in carbon dioxide and temperature irrespective of industrial greenhouse gases. Put simply, when it comes to climate change the dominant factor is natural causes due to the sun’s solar activity. \n\nYes, it is the sun!!! The UN, WEF and EU narrative: The related fanfare and fearmongering, that human activity and high carbon leads to climate change is false accusation. Using their so-called solutions this hoax continues to wreak havoc through global environmental devastation under the guise of “saving the world.” False environmental claim #2 – You can trust the science. You should not trust the climate science. The science has been ideologically twisted, exaggerated and distorted for power, profit and political gains. Contradictory findings are left out. Those believing that the science is settled have been played. Hence the UN agenda 2030. As the saying goes when you mix science with politics you get: Politics. Scientists crying out climate crisis are bought and paid off by Big Government. Meanwhile, these scientists receive grants and if they ever dissented then their funding would run dry and they would be shown the door. Why do they keep restudying the climate change situation If the science was settled? False environmental claim #3 – Alternative green-based technologies are efficient solutions. Anybody who really understands the UN, WEF and the EU with their hidden ulterior New World Order motives would realize that green technologies are not about promoting viable solutions, nor do these institutions care about saving the world. \n\nIf you think these guys are looking out for you then you’re sorely mistaken. The overall inefficiency of alternative green-lit technologies beggars’ belief that anyone could take these so-called solutions seriously. The simple mathematical equation is: Energy Invested in alternative technologies produces far less returns. For one of many examples, research done by scientists such as Professor David MacKay ex-Cambridge University Professor and former UK government energy scientific advisor points out in his book entitled “Sustainable Energy Without Hot Air ” the ridiculousness of wind energy: He points out that in order to supply the UK’s wind energy demand it would need wind turbine infrastructure stretching across an area two times the size of the country of Wales. Wind turbine energy takes up significant fossil fuel demands as it can be unreliably inefficient, making it wasted money. False environmental claim #4 – EVs are eco-friendly efficient traffic solutions. Following on from above EVs are another example of energy inefficiency, while causing more harm to the environment than good.\n\n* In cold weather have their travel range significantly reduced needing more charging… * Battery manufacturing operations requires high fossil fuel energy. * Have been known to catch fire – questioning the safety. * Have batteries that require mined earth metals such as lithium, cobalt and rhodium. The mining and refining processes cause much pollution to the land, air and water at the area of manufacturing. Take, for instance, the town of Baotou, Inner Mongolia. * Mining these earth metals also involves slave labour. * Are around two-and-a-half times heavier than their fossil fuel equivalent, which would in turn greatly increase maintenance/repair costs for worn down roads and bridges infrastructure.",

        "text": "Don't be fooled by ‘per-capita emissions’ metrics \n\n Once again, Canada is being portrayed as an environmental laggard, and by implication, Canadians are being portrayed as morally dubious. Even the prime minister receives a drubbing. Why? Because declines in per-capita greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are not keeping pace with Canada’s peers in the G7. In Bloomberg , reporters Zahra Hirji and Akshat Rathi lay out the indictment. \n\nIn the seven years that Justin Trudeau has been prime minister, GHG emissions have plateaued while Canada’s GDP has increased by 8 per cent. Now to some people (perhaps most), this “planking the curve” might seem like an achievement. But apparently, it’s actually a failure since “all of Canada’s peers” in the G-7 have “managed to achieve economic growth while simultaneously cutting emissions.” Among the 20 major economies (or G20), “Canada ranks behind only Saudi Arabia” when it comes to per-capita emissions. Yes, we’re almost as bad as the Saudis and everyone knows what that means. We’re bad. This kind of accusation happens relatively often these days—the per-capita comparison has become a staple in the various environmental assessment reports put out by environmental groups worldwide. It’s also completely bogus. \n\nPer-capita metrics are often used to cast moral judgements inappropriately, and there’s an undertone in reporting about per-capita metrics that suggests it’s an indicator of selfishness. The Bloomberg article, with its emphasis on comparing Canada to the Saudis, paints Canadians as selfish gushers of GHGs. But again, this is a bum rap. As individuals, Canadians (like just about everyone else) can do little about their level of emissions. Canada is a large country with a relatively small highly-dispersed population. \n\nWe have long transportation distances and must deal with a wide range of often inclement temperatures and precipitation. Even if we Canadians became extremely energy efficient as individuals, we would still appear to have higher per-capita energy consumption, especially in comparison to the many small milder countries in the European Union, with their tiny transportation distances and relatively warmer climates. There’s also the broader fact that as individuals, nobody has much impact on the climate. \n\nAs Morten Byskov (himself a person deeply concerned about the climate) noted : “A recent report found that just 100 companies are responsible for 71% of global emissions since 1988. Incredibly, a mere 25 corporations and state-owned entities were responsible for more than half of global industrial emissions in that same period.” Byskov also noted that the magnitude of the world’s decarbonization goals is so large that talking about per-capita emissions, and creating the impression that individuals can impact the big picture with their own emission-reduction efforts, is simply a distraction. \n\n“Per capita focuses us on marginal decarbonization instead of deep decarbonization… Per capita makes us think about lifestyles rather than about government policy.” In other words, it’s disingenuous to slag Canada for losing the race to lower “per capita” emission levels because the use of “per capita” measurement in a climate change context is also disingenuous. The media should learn better than to carry such silliness at face value.",

        "text": "What is WBGT ? \n\n “The flooding had nothing to do with “climate change” – it was a fairly common stronger monsoon but with even more rain.” Right. It happened in- get this- a FLOOD PLAIN- which has probably flooded a million times (or more) in the past few million years. I’m always amazed when people think a flood is an unnatural event. It’s only unnatural if our human created infratructure fails. (dams, poorly designed structures in the flood plain, deforestation in the watershed, etc.)\n\nThe WBGT is an example of the increasing occurrence of scientism, in this case the use of numbers in specious observations to reach a pre-determined conclusion. The most important statement in the above is that WBGT is “ Just a number that can be compared only to other numbers of the same index. It is not a measure of sensible heat.” It’s not a reality but an abstraction.\n\nAhh, good times. Back in the 1980’s the environmental science department at the University of Lancaster, (Lancashire) would send scienceundergr aduates into the carpark to swing a wet bulb in the driving wintry rain. Well, you’ll be forgiven for not being surprised that it registered the same as the dry bulb. 100% humidity at 5 Celsius. Not nice, but it’s grim up North as they say over here.\n\nThe New! Improved! WBGT Index uses a metal globe painted black and positioned in direct sun to simulate the perceived heat of a person working outside. As such, it sounds like the pseudo-scientific equivalent of the “cooler” — a metal box where the prison camp commandant locked the British captive in the war movie “Bridge Over the River Kwai.” In other words, WBGT is a torture chamber used to intimidate the other prisoners. If there’s any science in this, it’s the science of propaganda to induce fear and despair into unwitting civilians held captive by climatista activists.\n\nColonel Nicholson came to his senses in that 1957 opus. It’s up for grabs if today’s mad hatters club will ever do the same.\n\nOMG! This is nothing more than the old familiar “heat index” we’ve had forever – with a few extra variables thrown in! This has *NOTHING* to do with predicting the future “heat index”. It’s nothing more than more of the old IBM “FUD” factor (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) being used by climate scientists trying to rationalize their belief in CAGW in order to keep the money and power flowing! My Vantage Vue weather station calculates what it labels THW. It’s the heat index (temp, humidity, wind). I’ve had it since 2012. If I were to add a UV meter it would calculate THSW (temp, humidty, sun, wind). And these folks think they have come up with something new?",

        "text": "Marxist Globalism Will Not Survive \n\n by J.B. Shurk, American Thinker:\n\nIn the end, Marxist globalism will fail. The Machiavellian push for One World Government will fail. The World Economic Forum’s master plan for a small cabal of egomaniacal “elites” to rule over Earth’s eight-billion-plus inhabitants will fail. Why? Because those who conspire to foist such despotism upon the rest of us have no meaningful vision for the future.\n\nSurviving in tiny apartments in mega-metropolises, owning nothing of our own, subsisting on a diet of bugs and Soylent Green, anesthetizing our minds with narcotics and virtual reality, and remaining in a perpetual state of fear over man-made “climate change” is no way to live. Existence without struggle, adventure, growth, or purpose is hollow. “Shouting your abortion” and volunteering for government-assisted suicide inspire no-one. Self-censoring speech breeds conformity, not creativity. Obsessing over what is “politically correct” leaves no space for original thought. Constantly worrying about being punished for spreading “disinformation” or being “cancelled” for offending the State is psychological torture.\n\nThe future that globalist “elites” wish to impose upon the rest of us is devoid of personal meaning. It is bereft of innovation and art. It is a death sentence for imagination. It drowns the soul in dread.\n\nA powerful alliance of central banks, espionage agencies, multinational corporations, and oppressive governments will continue to demand that the human race “voluntarily” accept the new digital cages being built around them, but we humans cannot be controlled forever. Rebelling against our masters is in our nature. Seeking our independence drives us into the wilderness. Risking everything for freedom is what makes too many of us feel most alive. The globalists can torture, intimidate, imprison, and murder us without mercy, but, in the end, they will fail to do anything other than steel our resolve and forge an implacable spirit among the populace. Marxist globalism will not survive.\n\nOne of the reasons it will not survive is that it is simply the reimposition of monarchy and aristocracy in twenty-first-century clothes. Royal prerogative and noble privilege have been refashioned as bureaucratic, financial, or scientific “expertise.” Secretaries-general of international bodies, directors of clandestine organizations, corporate officers, and central bank governors are just modern tsars and princes wielding high-tech, digital swords. Before the fall of most dynasties around the world, a peasant who asked, “Why should I do what you say?” would be told with the help of a firm whip or rod, “Because I am your lord, and you must obey.” Today, when a commoner asks, “Why must I use fiat money, close my business for COVID, or allow school counselors to give my child puberty blockers behind my back?” a government representative insists that we are not qualified to question the “experts.”\n\nPutting a title before someone’s name — especially the word, “doctor” — is used to evince authority in the same manner as a king bestows privilege upon a baron, count, or duke. Just as aristocrats are not genetically superior to those they seek to “rule,” “experts” are not any more immune to errors in judgment than those they seek to regulate. As a reader going by the name of “Grandpa” recently observed, “In my lifetime, ‘science’ said a frontal lobotomy was the cure for a host of mental illnesses. ‘Science’ said we would be a frozen world by 1980…Now, ‘science’ is saying a man can become a woman and a woman a man.” Science, as Grandpa suggests, is often no more than a heraldic shield used to deflect criticism while demanding unearned respect.\n\nAnother reason Marxist globalism will not survive is that it stands for no principle beyond the pursuit and exercise of raw power. It is a religion that glorifies a handful of global “elites” as gods and demands that everyone else accede to their philosophies as gospel truths. However, Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab, George Soros, Al Gore, John Kerry, Barack Obama, and their fellow WEF enthusiasts are false prophets who serve no greater interest than their own. They have made themselves into globalist idols for mindless followers to profanely worship. And like all false idols, they will lead their acolytes to their own demise.",

        "text": "SHEER LUNACY: Bill Gates funding plan to cut down 70M acres of forests in America “to combat global warming” \n\n This is another proof that \"global warming\" is a scam to make the rich become richer. The true reason for the devastation of forests is to acquire saleable carbon offsets.\n\nGates' plan to take advantage of the natural world for the sake of \"climate change\" was promoted in an article titled: \"Chop Down Forests to Save the Planet? Maybe Not as Crazy as it Sounds.\" (Related: Bill Gates bankrolling DESTRUCTION OF ALL TREES to stop \"global warming.\")\n\nThe last sentence of the article provides a clue to what this newest scam is all about, which is money.\n\nThe said article connects carbon to trading of carbon credits and carbon offsets, which is about the idea to plant trees to suck carbon dioxide from the air and sell the credits to corporations, private jet owners and others who require or wish to cancel out their emissions.\n\nAccording to Dr. Patrick Moore, the co-founder and former leader of Greenpeace, calling carbon dioxide (CO2) a pollutant is dangerous propaganda. Examining satellite imagery shows how CO2 as nature's fertilizer has regularly been enriching Earth's atmosphere.\n\nAnd a study carried out on data from 1750 to 2018 has shown this as well. The study calculated that the amount of the atmospheric concentration of anthropogenic fossil-derived CO2 in 2018 was 46.84 ppm out of a total of 405.40 ppm.\n\nThe U.S. Forest Service plans to reduce 70 million acres of western forests, mainly in California, over the next decade by removing more than one billion tons of bone-dry biomass. This idea came up following the series of wildfires in California three years ago.\n\nBut Roger Pielke, a professor in the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Colorado, noted that wildfires used to be much more widespread in past centuries and they are a part of the natural ecosystem. Wildfires around the world were mostly due to human intervention, not the climate change that corporate media supports.\n\nThe fires in Greece, Spain, Italy and the Amazon rainforest are most probably because of arson.\n\nMeanwhile, Yale Carbon Containment (CC) Lab, Kodama's partner, is looking forward to making a business out of \"earthen vaults\" or \"biomass vaults.\"\n\nAfter a forest thinning, it is usual for logs of marketable size to show up at sawmills, with most of the rest stacked up and then burned under controlled conditions. Kodama prefers to bury the leftovers instead in earthen vaults designed to keep dry and anoxic (oxygen-free) conditions and protect the wood from burning or rotting.\n\n\"The greatest risk for this project is the high cost of transporting wood from dispersed sources to a single storage site. Transporting wet wood is significantly more time and energy-intensive than leaving it in the forest. Logistics greatly impact project viability, even if the price of carbon is high,\" said CC Lab. The company also admitted that biomass vaults are not reasonable, and that \"the carbon containment value of burying large volumes of wood may be offset partially or totally by the carbon released from the soils when excavating a storage pit.\"\n\nAccording to Merritt Jenkins, Kodama's co-founder and chief executive, they plan to make money from their forest thinning work by selling usable timber and carbon credits from its burial projects. Kodama has already accepted $1.1 million in grants from California's forest fire agency and other organizations.\n\nKodama ultimately wants to chop down and bury more than 5,000 tons of trees annually.",

Russia has more than 100,000 troops massed near Ukraine, and the United States has warned that an attack could begin in the coming days. Moscow denies any such plans and has accused the West of \"hysteria\". \n\nNonetheless, governments and towns near the Ukrainian border, from north to south, are getting ready to take in refugees, if needed. Poland, which is home to between 1 million and 2 million Ukrainians, who mostly came to the country to work, said on Monday it was preparing for a worst case scenario. Deputy Foreign Minister Marcin Przydacz told Catholic broadcaster Radio Plus he was \"preparing for large numbers so as to be better prepared\". The mayor of the eastern Polish town of Ciechanow, which has a population of around 44,000, said it was ready to receive around 80 refugees in a hotel within 48 hours, at a cost of 140 zlotys per night including food. \n\n\"We have been assured that the state budget will fully cover the costs,\" Krzysztof Kosinski told Reuters. On Sunday, the northern town of Elblag said it had 420 places available. The central Polish city of Torun said it had 96 places for refugees. In the south, the city of Czestochowa said it has 1,100 places. 'NO HOPE OF RETURN' Romania, which also shares a long border with Ukraine, finalised an action plan on Sunday, Interior Minister Lucian Bode told private television station B1. \n\n\"We know that Poland is preparing to take 1 million migrants. Is Romania ready to take hundreds of thousands of refugees in an uncontrolled influx?,\" he said. \n\"We have taken several hypotheses into account ... We are currently analysing how many refugee camps we can install in a relatively short time, 10, 12, 24 hours. We are analysing existing lodging capacities in border counties but we are also discussing the second stage, with neighbouring counties, and the third stage across the country.\" Slovakia's defence minister has said that there may be tens of thousands of refugees even under a limited conflict. Interior Minister Robert Mikulec said the government was preparing for various scenarios with its armed forces and was in close contact with the authorities in Ukraine. \n\nHungary, which has over 150,000 ethnic Hungarians living in Ukraine and tens of thousands of immigrant workers from Ukraine, is also making preparations. \"We also have a playbook and an action plan in the event of war,\" Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Saturday, stressing that \"Hungary's interests are clear: first and foremost, war must be avoided\". Orban flagged the possibility of hundreds of thousands of refugees arriving in the case of war. \"Think back to the 1990s, when tens of thousands of people arrived from the former Yugoslav territories. That was not easy either – but many more would come from Ukraine, probably with no hope of return,\" he said. \n\nThe Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have also said they were readying to accept refugees. Lithuania's interior minister last week said the government asked municipalities to list available housing, adding they expected refugees to come mainly from Poland and on flights. The Latvian Interior Ministry is considering a string of refugee centres along its eastern border to house undocumented Ukrainian refugees with no place to stay, BNS news wire reported on Monday. The plan would need government approval.",

But forget protecting our own border and the burdens on American taxpayers.\n\nIt seems our government is captured and risks our lives and welfare in the interest of another country.\n\nIt seems everyone in Washington, Republicans and Democrats, especially Republicans, have intense war fever. While Washington quickly escalated the conflict by deploying US military forces to the area, the Republican Senator from South Carolina, Lindsey Graham, blames escalation on Iran and issues a threat: “if you escalate this war, we’re coming for you.” Graham continues with his threats, in our name, to Iran saying the US will “knock Iran out of the oil business.” Like Israel and the Jewish-American neoconservatives, Graham’s target is the Lebanese militia, Hezbollah: “I am poised to use military force to destroy the source of funding for Hamas and Hezbollah.”\n\nAnother House Republican, this one from Texas, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, says he is writing legislation for authority to commit the US military to Israel’s war on Palestine.\n\nWhat we are witnessing is Republicans who are as extreme as Hamas. Is this insanity real, or is this showmanship, with political campaign funding in mind, for the US military/security complex who will greatly benefit from America “affording two wars?”\n\nWe are also witnessing the total failure of Western leadership, not only in Washington but throughout the Western world.

Why did not Washington calm the situation down instead of blowing it up?\n\nI have been, and continue to be, concerned about the conflict in Ukraine spiraling out of control.

This goes well with it already being known that the labs were being used to study how to get pandemics to spread via migratory animals – that’s why in China it showed up in bats.\n\nUnder Secretary of State Victoria Nuland threw gas on the topic by stating “We are now in fact quite concerned that Russian troops, Russian forces, may be seeking to gain control of those labs, so we are working with the Ukranians on how they can prevent any of those research materials from falling into the hands of Russian forces should they approach”\n\nMy comment: If Russia went into Ukraine for “no reason”, why would those biolabs be any concern at all? The reaction from Nuland really bolsters the claims made by the employees that worked at the labs. Yes, they may have defected but doing that with the actual materials in your hand would be a tough gig and such proof increases credibility greatly. Now we have confirmation from Nuland that there really is something the West wants to hide which greatly negates the need for the whistleblowers to bring to Putin absolute proof (seriously impossible when fleeing Ukranian assassins).

Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny is dead. The slaughter in Gaza continues with no end in sight. The Yemeni Houthis are attacking ships in the Red Sea. The North Koreans are testing intercontinental ballistic missiles. In normal times, pessimism can look like an intellectual fad. In times like these, it becomes a starker form of realism.\n\nThe post-1945 world order — written into international law, ratified by the United Nations, and kept in place by the balance of nuclear terror among major powers — is hanging by a thread. The United States is divided against itself and stretched to the limits of its capabilities. Europe is waking up to the possibility that, come November, America may no longer fulfill its collective-defense obligations under Article 5 of the NATO treaty. Faced with this new uncertainty, Europe is cranking up its defense production, and European politicians are screwing up the courage to persuade their electorates that they will need to ante up 2% of their GDP to guarantee their own safety.\n\nThe Western alliance doesn’t just face the challenge of doubling down on defense while maintaining unity across the Atlantic. It also now faces an “axis of resistance” that might be tempted to threaten Western hegemony with a simultaneous, coordinated challenge. The lynchpin of this axis is the Russia-China “no-limits” partnership. While the Chinese supply the Russians with advanced circuitry for their weapons systems, Russian President Vladimir Putin ships them cheap oil. Together they have imposed autocratic rule over most of Eurasia.\n\nIf Ukraine’s exhausted defenders are forced to concede Russian sovereignty over Crimea and the Donbas region, the Eurasian axis of dictators will have succeeded in changing a European land frontier by force. Achieving this will threaten every state on the edge of Eurasia: Taiwan, the Baltic countries, and even Poland. Both dictatorial regimes will use their vetoes on the U.N. Security Council to ratify conquest, effectively consigning the U.N. Charter to history’s dustbin.\n\nThis partnership of dictators works in tandem with a cluster of rights-abusing renegades, led by Iran and North Korea. The North Koreans provide Putin with artillery shells while plotting to invade the rest of their peninsula. The Iranians manufacture the drones that terrorize Ukrainians in their trenches. Meanwhile, Iran’s proxies — Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis — are helping Russia and China by tying down America and Israel.\n\nUnless the U.S. can force Israel into a long-term ceasefire, it will find itself struggling to control conflicts on three fronts (Asia, Europe, and the Middle East). Not even a country that outspends its rivals on defense by two to one can maintain a war footing simultaneously across so many theaters.\n\nThe idea that democracies around the world will join up with America and Europe against the authoritarian threat seems like an illusion. Instead of joining with the embattled democracies of the Global North, the rising democracies of the Global South — Brazil, India, and South Africa — seem unembarrassed to be aligning with regimes that rely on mass repression, the cantonment of entire populations (the Uighurs in China), and shameless murder (Navalny being only the most recent example).\n\nTo be sure, the authoritarian axis currently is united only by what it opposes: American power. It is otherwise divided by its ultimate interests. The Chinese, for example, cannot be overjoyed that the Houthis are blocking freight traffic through the Red Sea. The world’s second most powerful economy doesn’t have all that much in common with an impoverished Muslim resistance army or with theocratic Iran.\n\nMoreover, both Russia and China remain parasitic beneficiaries of a global economy that is sustained by U.S. alliances and deterrence. That is why they still hesitate to challenge the hegemon too directly. However, like sharks, they smell blood in the water. They have not only survived U.S. sanctions but continued to prosper, replacing their dependence on embargoed markets with new markets in Latin America, Asia, and India. Both Russia and China have discovered that American control of the global economy is not what it once was.\n\nThis discovery of American weakness might tempt them to risk a joint military challenge. As matters stand, U.S. diplomacy and deterrence have successfully kept the axis divided. CIA Director William Burns and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan are keeping the channels open to China. Blowback American strikes against Iran have apparently convinced the theocrats to rein in Hezbollah and the militias in Iraq — though not the Houthis, whom nobody seems able to control.\n\nIt doesn’t take strategic genius to see the opportunity China and Russia might be contemplating. If they decided to mount an overt challenge to the American order — for example, with a coordinated, simultaneous offensive against Ukraine and Taiwan — the U.S. would struggle to rush weapons and technology into the breach.\n\nNuclear weapons would not necessarily deter China and Russia from risking a coordinated attempt to take Taiwan and the rest of Ukraine. All parties would pay a horrendous price, but Russia has shown what it is willing to expend in Ukraine, and both China and Russia may believe that there will never be a more opportune moment to overthrow American hegemony. If they were to combine forces, we would face the most serious challenge to the global economic and strategic order since 1945.\n\nNobody has any idea what the world would be like on the other side of such a confrontation. We cannot even assume, as we have always done, that America would prevail if faced with a simultaneous challenge from two formidable powers. If a pessimist is someone who imagines the worst in order to forestall it, we should all be pessimists. Keeping the authoritarian axis from becoming a full-fledged alliance should be America’s first-order priority.",

        "text": "'Pure Junk Science': Researchers Challenge Narrative On CO2 And Warming Correlation \n\n 'Pure Junk Science': Researchers Challenge Narrative On CO2 And Warming Correlation\n\nAuthored by Katie Spence via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),\n\nEach year from 2023 to 2030, climate change sustainable development goals will cost every person in economies such as the United States $2,026, the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development estimates. In lower-income economies, the per-person annual cost ranges from $332 to $1,864.\n\nIn total, the global price tag comes to about $5.5 trillion per year.\n\nSeparately, a report from the left-aligned nonprofit Climate Policy Initiative found that in 2021 and 2022, the world’s taxpayers spent $1.3 trillion each year on climate-related projects.\n\nIt also found that the “annual climate finance needed” from 2031 to 2050 is more than $10 trillion each year.\n\n“Anyone who willfully denies the impact of climate change is condemning the American people to a very dangerous future,” President Joe Biden said on Nov. 14, 2023, while announcing $6 billion in new investments through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).\n\n“The impacts we’re seeing are only going to get worse, more frequent, more ferocious, and more costly.”\n\nAt its signing in August 2022, President Biden said the IRA “invests $369 billion to take the most aggressive action ever—ever, ever, ever—in confronting the climate crisis and strengthening our economic—our energy security.”\n\nA report from Goldman Sachs put the dollar amount much higher, stating, “Critical funding for this next energy revolution is expected to come from the IRA, which will provide an estimated $1.2 trillion of incentives by 2032.”\n\nThe trillions of dollars being poured into new initiatives stem from the goals set by the United Nations’ Paris Agreement’s legally binding international treaty to “substantially reduce global greenhouse gas emissions” in the hope of maintaining a temperature of no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.\n\nBut any decrease in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions won’t have an effect for hundreds to thousands of years—even under the most restrictive circumstances, according to some experts.\n\n“If emissions of CO2 stopped altogether, it would take many thousands of years for atmospheric CO2 to return to ‘pre-industrial’ levels,” the Royal Society states in a report on its website. The organization describes itself as a “fellowship of many of the world’s most eminent scientists.”\n\n“Surface temperatures would stay elevated for at least a thousand years, implying a long-term commitment to a warmer planet due to past and current emissions,” the report states. “The current CO2-induced warming of Earth is therefore essentially irreversible on human timescales.”\n\nA frequently asked questions page on NASA’s website holds the same position.\n\n“If we stopped emitting greenhouse gases today, the rise in global temperatures would begin to flatten within a few years. Temperatures would then plateau but remain well-elevated for many, many centuries,” NASA states.\n\nAnd, other scientists say, that’s because CO2 isn’t the culprit in the first place.\n\n“CO2 does not cause global warming. Global warming causes more CO2,” said Edwin Berry, a theoretical physicist and certified consulting meteorologist. He called Royal Society’s position on CO2 “pure junk science.”\n\nIan Clark, emeritus professor for the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of Ottawa, agreed that if all greenhouse gas emissions ceased today, the Earth would continue warming—but not because of CO2.\n\nHe said that contrary to popular opinion, temperature doesn’t follow CO2—instead, CO2 follows temperature, which, itself, is due to solar activity.\n\nTemperature and CO2\n\nOne of Mr. Clark’s primary areas of research is paleoclimatology (the study of climate conditions using indirect records such as tree ring data, ice cores, and other proxy records), and in particular, Arctic paleohydrogeology, which is the study of the Earth’s water throughout history.\n\n“During the ice ages, we had great temperature variations, and this has to do with, not straight-up solar activity, but the amount of solar activity that is hitting the Earth at certain important latitudes, all caused by celestial events,” Mr. Clark said.\n\n“The Earth, in our solar system, is moving around and being jostled. And we have different orbiting patterns that affect solar input, and that creates ice ages and interglacial periods—which we’re in now. And CO2 tracks that. So we'll see enormous temperature changes, going from ice ages to interglacials, and CO2 gets very low during ice ages and very high during interglacials.\n\n“And that gives the appearance that CO2 is driving the climate, but it’s actually following. It lags by about 800 years.”\n\nMr. Clark said that during ice ages, and particularly the past 10,000 years, scientists have a fairly good idea of the temperature, thanks to proxy records. He said those records show that the Medieval Warm Period was likely much warmer than today, and agriculture and civilization flourished.\n\nBut the Little Ice Age followed that from the 1400s to 1800s. “And that’s when we had difficulty with agriculture,” Mr. Clark said.\n\n“The Thames froze over. We have all sorts of recollections about how cold, and some would say miserable, it was back then. But then it started warming up again. So, about every 1,000 years or so, we seem to have these fluctuations. This is due to solar activity, and that’s where we see the importance of the sun, which is the ultimate source of energy beyond geothermal and nuclear energy. Solar drives climate.”\n\nAnother peer-reviewed study, by scientist William Jackson, examined the relationship between CO2 levels and temperature over the past 425 million years.\n\nMr. Jackson is a distinguished research and emeritus professor for the department of chemistry at UC–Davis who specializes in understanding the role that molecules such as CO2, nitrogen, and carbon monoxide play in planetary atmospheres.\n\nHis paper, published in 2017, found that “changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration did not cause temperature change in the ancient climate.”\n\nSimilarly, a group of researchers whose report was published in Nature found that when looking at carbon isotope compositions at the million-year scale, long-term atmospheric carbon dioxide was unrelated to temperature, and even showed an inverse trend, especially after major events such as volcanic eruptions.\n\nThey further found that when temperature and atmospheric CO2 reached a certain level, organic carbon burial drastically increased, eventually resulting in a significant decrease in atmospheric CO2 levels.\n\nThat activity, Mr. Berry said, is nature balancing the levels of CO2—which is an ongoing process.",

        "text": "The Electric Vehicle (EV) House Of Cards Is COLLAPSING: “Honeymoon Is Over … Don’t Expect The Marriage Itself To Last Much Longer Either” \n\n ) We were told they would be one of the key facets of a “clean, green” future, but electric vehicles (EVs) are rapidly – and here is why. You see, the EV scam was hastily hatched by far-leftists who are so detached from reality that they actually believe it is possible to just stop using earth-based fossil fuels on some arbitrary timeline with nothing viable to replace them. Not only that, but “green” enthusiasts seem to lack the cognition necessary to see that there is no workable infrastructure in place to even accommodate the use of EVs as a total replacement for cars with internal combustion engines.\n\n“The mass conversion from internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEs) to electric vehicles was never more than a Democrat / environmentalist hallucination anyway,” says Dr. Ron Ross, PhD. “It was the most ill-conceived government policy objective in modern history. The transition should have been a nonstarter. It’s riddled with numerous deal killers. It’s like having a dozen fatal diseases all at the same time.” (Related: about why EVs have been a scam from the very beginning.) When the EV house of cards finally falls, TRILLIONS of dollars will have been lost. In a piece he wrote for the Climate Change Dispatch that was also picked up by Climate Depot , Ross explains at great length what would need to be in place just to create the possibility that a nationwide fleet of 100 percent EVs would work.\n\nFor one, energy generation and grid expansion would need to at least double, and very quickly. With the arbitrary deadlines the greenies have put in place, one of the big ones being Agenda 2030, that type of rapid expansion is simply impossible. There is a reason why there was never any market research or feasibility studies done on the EV transition. Had they been, the results would have shown what we are now all finding out in real time: that EVs are a lost cause. “The electric vehicle honeymoon is over,” Ross contends. “Don’t expect the marriage itself to last much longer either.” Another thing the greenies never considered is the lengthy charging times for EVs. While a gas-powered vehicle can be refilled with gas at any one of the tens of thousands of gas stations that dot the United States landscape, EVs take hours to charge – assuming you can even find a charger. Someone with an EV who lives in California, for instance, would not even make it through Arizona, let alone all the way through Texas, if they were, say, taking a road trip to Florida. “Did they truly believe everyone would tolerate spending hours to charge their vehicles rather than the minutes they were accustomed to?” Ross asks. Sales data clearly shows that the American public is simply not interested, either due to cost or impracticality, in buying an EV. Heck, even car rental companies are having trouble getting their customers to rent an EV for a day or two, let alone buy one. Even so, car manufacturers are continuing to ramp up EV production. This means that, in time, there will be EV graveyards full of unsold EVs, resulting in untold billions of dollars in losses and serious economic repercussions.\n\n“We are spending trillions on a fabricated dream, all for imaginary payoffs decades in the future,” Ross writes. “When the EV house of cards collapses what will the reaction be? Ordinarily, for normal persons, it should be a time for regret, rethinking, and humility … It would be good if the Democrat / environmentalist true believers learned something from the EV debacle.” There is nothing clean or green about EVs.
