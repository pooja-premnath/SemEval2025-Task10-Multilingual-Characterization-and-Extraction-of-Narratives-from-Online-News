Now the same global warming is supposed to be increasing their frequency? Does not compute. NOAA Research said: ‘The annual number of tropical cyclones forming globally has decreased by approximately 13% during the 20th century, and scientists say the main cause is a rise in global warming, according to a new study in Nature Climate Change by a group of international scientists including NOAA scientists.’\n\n– – –\n\nEurekAlert news release: Climate: Increasing tropical cyclone frequency may have deadly consequences for seabird populations\n\nThe increase in tropical cyclone frequency and intensity due to climate change could lead to dramatic declines in seabird populations, suggests a paper published in Communications Earth & Environment.\n\nThe authors’ conclusion is based on the impacts of Cyclone Ilsa on Bedout Island, after the cyclone killed at least 80% of seabirds nesting on the island when it struck in April 2023.\n\nClimate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, including tropical cyclones.\n\nIndividual cyclones can have a dramatic impact on wildlife populations, including seabirds. Cyclones directly affect seabirds in several ways, including causing significant mortality events, disrupting their nesting and breeding patterns, and altering migration strategies.\n\nThe increasing frequency of cyclones is already known to have negative impacts on a range of organisms, but the impact on seabird populations is still unclear.\n\nJennifer Lavers and colleagues studied the impact of Cyclone Ilsa, a category 5 tropical cyclone, on the populations of several seabird species breeding on the 17-hectare Bedout Island, Western Australia, after the cyclone crossed the island on April 13 2023.\n\nThey used aerial and ground surveys, conducted between April 17 and July 21 2023, to estimate the percentage mortality of three species — the brown booby (Sula leucogaster), the lesser frigatebird (Fregata ariel), and an endemic subspecies of the masked booby (Sula dactylatra bedouti).\n\nThe authors estimate that 80–90% of these species’ populations — at least 20,000 individual birds — were killed during the storm, with the losses predominantly adult breeding birds.\n\nThe authors warn that this level of population loss for island seabirds may be unsustainable when coupled with the increase in cyclone frequency, as many seabirds are long-lived, have long generation times, and raise very few chicks per year.\n\nFull article here.\n\n– – –\n\nImage: Tropical storm [credit: BBC]\n\nThe Klimate Klowns have not made one prediction that came through Not one.

Climate crazies tried — and failed — to glue themselves to Edvard Munch’s 1893 painting “The Scream” in Oslo on Friday.\n\nIt was yet another example of climate change activists using priceless works of art to protest the use of fossil fuels, which climate zealots believe is leading to global warming. In October, climate activists attacked “Girl with a Pearl Earring” by Johannes Vermeer in The Hague. Climate hysterics were also responsible for an attack on Van Gogh’s “Sunflowers” and John Constable’s “The Hay Wain” in London over the summer.\n\nThe new climate-related vandalism fad seems to have begun with an attack on Da Vinci’s “Mona Lisa” in which a climate fanatic feigned a disability in order to get close enough to smear a pastry on the painting.\n\nIn addition, “Peach Trees in Blossom” by Van Gogh; “My Heart’s in the Highlands” by Horatio McCulloch; “Tomson’s Aeolian Harp” by J.M.W. Turner; “The Last Supper” by Giampietrino; “Sistine Madonna” by Raphael; and “Haystacks” by Monet have been targeted by climate hysterics since May.\n\nAs of yet, none of the artwork has been damaged, due to being protected by glass.\n\nVideo of Friday’s attack shows two young climate vandals attempting to glue themselves to the artwork. Police apprehended the hooligans, and reported there was some glue residue on the glass that protects the paintings.\n\n“I scream for people dying,” one of the activists shouted.\n\n“I scream when lawmakers ignore science,” the other shouted.\n\nThe Norwegian climate activist group Stopp Oljeletinga, which translates to “Stop Oil Exploration,” claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nThe group demands that the Norwegian government declare “an immediate halt to all further exploration for oil on the Norwegian continental shelf,” and present “a concrete plan for fair adjustment for today’s oil workers.”\n\nA spokesperson for the group claimed that the vandalism was an attempt to “pressure lawmakers into stopping oil exploration.”\n\n“We are campaigning against ‘Scream’ because it is perhaps Norway’s most famous painting,” said Astrid Rem, a spokesperson for Stopp Oljeletinga. “There have been lots of similar actions around Europe. They have managed something that no other action has managed: achieve an extremely large amount of coverage and press.”\n\nBut there’s good press and there’s bad press. These crazy antics are of the bad variety.\n\nNorway is one of the world’s top oil exporters and provides oil and natural gas to much of Europe, a continent in the midst of a serious energy crunch brought about partly by the war in Ukraine. Russia, the largest supplier of natural gas to Europe, has severely restricted supplies and has shut down the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which it claims was sabotaged.\n\nWithout much-needed Norwegian fossil fuels, Europe could be in for an extremely cold winter.\n\nThe art world has acknowledged their concern over the new phenomenon:\n\n“In recent weeks, there have been several attacks on works of art in international museum collections. The activists responsible for them severely underestimate the fragility of these irreplaceable objects, which must be preserved as part of our world cultural heritage,” read a statement signed by approximately one hundred gallery directors and museums.\n\nThese climate crazies are apparently willing to allow a continent to freeze this winter over their fears of an over-hyped “problem” peddled by globalists who flew more than 400 carbon-spewing private jets to COP27 in Egypt last week. If they truly believe the hype surrounding climate change, they’re targeting the wrong thing.",

Illia Ponomarenko of the Kyiv Independent claims that the UMPK (unified module for gliding and navigation) technologies appear to be turning ordinary bombs into intelligent ones. \n\nThe enhanced guided or gliding bombs, according to Ponomarenko, present “an especially serious threat to Ukraine” and have the ability to “deliver devastating hits upon Ukrainian lines and the rear front.” According to the site, this device can be used to give Russia’s plentiful supply of outdated Soviet FAB-500M-62 gravity bombs “wings” and a basic satellite navigation system. Russian bombs that had been modified were successfully employed in March to strike Ukrainian defences in Avdiivka, Donetsk. According to Russian media, the production of the kit costs less than 2 million roubles, or about $24,000, making it significantly less expensive than buying missiles and other weaponry from abroad. \n\nIn contrast, one Kalibr cruise missile, which Russia used frequently in its invasion of Ukraine, costs just under $6.5 million. The JDAM-ER kits, which turn existing unguided bombs into precision-guided munitions, were given by the US to Ukraine, and they are identical to the system. Although Russia has not acknowledged making the UMPK kits in substantial quantities, this would be a practical substitute for pricey cruise and ballistic missiles, the stock of which is already largely exhausted. \n\nAccording to estimations from the Ukrainian air force, these weapons can have an effective range of more than 50 kilometers, or about 31 miles, the Kyiv Independent said. According to the article, the Ukrainian air force calculates that up to 20 guided bomb hits are made every day along the front line by Russian Su-34 and Sukhoi Su-35 aircraft that are launched from higher heights. \n\nUkraine must use air defence systems like the S-300 to fend off the jets in order to stop the Russian attack. According to recently released Pentagon documents, Kyiv’s supply of S-300 weapons is running low and may run out in May. On Wednesday, a number of Patriot missile defence systems sent by Western partners arrived in Ukraine. Additionally, Ukraine has been frantically searching for more ammo for its air defence systems, which have been essential to protect against Russian planes. \n\nAs its Mikoyan MiG-29 and Sukhoi Su-27 are obsolete and do not have contemporary longer-range air-to-air missiles, Ukraine has also been pleading for its Western friends to supply fighter jets to protect against Russian assaults. \n\nThis week, Germany granted Poland’s request to give Ukraine five MiG-29 fighter planes.

It has a nuclear warhead with four power options, selectable depending on the target to be destroyed. It is not dropped vertically, but at a distance from the target on which it is directed guided by a satellite system. It can penetrate underground, exploding deep to destroy command center bunkers in a nuclear first strike.\n\nThe B61-12s, classified as “non-strategic nuclear weapons,” are deployed in Europe — in Italy, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Britain and probably other countries — at distances far enough to strike Russia. They thus have offensive capabilities similar to those of strategic weapons.\n\nAnother nuclear weapon system, which the United States is preparing to install in Europe against Russia, is ground-based intermediate-range missiles. They can also be launched from “anti-missile shield” installations, deployed by the U.S. at bases in Deveselu in Romania and Redzikowo in Poland, and aboard five warships cruising in the Mediterranean, Black Sea and Baltic Sea close to Russia.\n\nThat such installations have offensive capabilities is confirmed by Lockheed Martin itself. Outlining the characteristics of the Mk 41 vertical launch system, used in both land and naval installations, it specifies that it is capable of launching “missiles for all missions, both defense and long-range attack, including Tomahawk cruise missiles.” These can be armed with nuclear warheads.\n\nEurope is thus being turned by the U.S. into the front line of a nuclear confrontation with Russia, even more dangerous than that of the Cold War.\n\nThis article was originally published on byoblu.

Crucially, we are told, “it’s down to where the jet stream is”.\n\nIn an appeal to authority, without identifying any specific sources, Esme Stallard, climate and science reporter, with the assistance of all-purpose hack Sean Seddon, tell us that “meteorologists say” the wet and cool weather is due to the position of the jet stream, a core of strong winds sitting about five to seven miles above the Earth’s surface, and which dictate much of the UK’s weather.\n\nThe jet stream, we are then told, marks the boundary of cold air to the north in the polar regions and hot air to the south, a contrast which produces pressure differences. And last year, the jet stream was positioned further north, so the UK saw warm and dry weather created by the high-pressure system sitting over the country.\n\nAccording to these BBC sages, what is different about this month is that the jet stream has been stuck to the south of the UK, meaning its low-pressure system has been bringing cold and wet weather.\n\nThis is actually a pretty poor explanation of the meridional flow pattern which has been dominating the weather for a couple of years now, but that is of less concern than the need to tie in the phenomenon with global warming.\n\nAnd here, the formula used is classic is its dishonesty. “Some scientists think”, we are told, as if that is sufficient authority for what comes next. These wondrously anonymous “scientists” apparently think that higher temperatures due to climate change in the Arctic are causing the jet stream to slow, increasing the likelihood of high pressure and hot weather remaining in place. But that’s it – that’s all we get, followed by the assertion that “global warming means hot temperatures and wetter periods will become more typical for the UK”.\n\nRead more: Media weather anomalies and the propagandist BBC",

This time the news agency accuses the Daily Sceptic of “cherry-picking” Arctic sea ice extent data to provide a “misleading” story. Being accused of “cherry picking” by an outfit that funds a course for journalists that encourages them to pick a fruit such as a mango and discuss why it isn’t as tasty as the year before due to climate change is beyond ridicule. Taking lectures on responsible journalism from a Net Zero-obsessed operation that has promoted a course speaker who has suggested “fines and imprisonments” for expressing scepticism about “well supported” science is laughable, if also a tad sinister.\n\nOne of the activists called to admonish the Daily Sceptic with a ‘straw man’ argument was Walt Meier, a research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Centre, who said: “Comparing two specific years is not an indicator for or against long-term changes”. The Daily Sceptic did not do that. Interestingly, this would appear to be the same Walt Meier whose comments on ”mind blowing” low winter levels of Antarctica sea ice last year made headlines around the world. Meier claimed at the time that it was “outside anything we have seen”. Happily, the Daily Sceptic was able to remind Meier that he had been part of a team a decade ago that cracked open the secrets of early Nimbus weather satellites and found a similar sea ice low in 1966. At the time, Meier commented that the Nimbus data show there is variability in Antarctica sea ice “that’s larger than any we have seen” since 1979.\n\nRead more: Reuters Joins BBC in Failed ‘Fact Check’ of Daily Sceptic Arctic Sea Ice Story",

Boot’s argument is delusional, but then neocons thrive on lies and delusions.\n\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\n\nPropaganda, pure and simple. Boot is an accessory to mass murder, having advocated the invasion of Iraq, the slaughter of over a million Iraqis, and the engineered destruction of their country.\n\nThe hypocritical ICC didn’t bother to contrast and compare Putin’s supposed abduction of Ukrainian children to an organized mass kidnapping of Vietnamese children. It was dubbed “Operation Babylift,” ordered by then President Ford, and was conducted at the end of the Vietnam War as the USG evacuated, having lost the war.\n\nThe Vietnamese children abducted without permission were described as “orphans,” although many had parents and relatives that were left behind. 3,300 children, described as “infants” (many were older children), were parceled out to families in America, Australia, West Germany, and France.\n\nThe “rescue” of these children was an organized act of kidnapping pure and simple, yet in the Land of Amnesia, millions of Americans know nothing about it (or, for that matter, the Vietnam War itself and the brutal destruction of Southeast Asia).\n\nIn 1975, a class action suit was filed in San Francisco on behalf of the kidnapped children.\n\n“The suit seeks to enjoin adoption proceedings until it has been ascertained either that the parents or appropriate relatives in Vietnam have consented to their adoption or that these parents or relatives cannot be found,” The Adoption History Project notes. “The Complaint alleged that several of the Vietnamese orphans brought to the United States under Operation Babylift stated they are not orphans and that they wish to return to Vietnam.”\n\nA statement issued on April 4, 1975, by “professors of ethics and religion,” pointed out that many “of the children are not orphans; their parents or relatives may still be alive, although displaced, in Vietnam… The Vietnamese children should be allowed to stay in Vietnam where they belong.”\n\nThe operation was celebrated by the corporate media and “Hollywood’s celebrity elite… [and, as a propaganda event] generated a spectacle of celebration and emphasized that the babies were more than just average orphans,” writes US History Scene.\n\nUncritical acceptance of the Vietnam war orphans did not last long. A variety of American voices that ranged from child psychologists to news reporters to the casual observer soon began asking whether the evacuation served the best interests of the children. This concern followed closely on the heels of criticism over U.S. motivation for the evacuation. Much of this controversy began when the unclear orphan status of some of the children came to light. The government of South Vietnam reluctantly allowed so many children to leave the country only under the condition that those who left would already be in the adoption process. Volunteers processing the children found that not all of them fit into this category of orphan. In the processing centers, some of the children told the volunteers that they were not orphans and had families living back in Vietnam.\n\nNaturally, Operation Babylift is all but forgotten today. It would be counterproductive to the onslaught of USG and ICC propaganda, not directed at the welfare of children, but rather as a crude “informational” device to further turn opinion against Russia’s SMO to denazify and disarm Ukraine and, in addition, prevent NATO from undermining Russian national security.\n\nRead More @ kurtnimmo.substack.com",

However, there is another viewpoint.\n\nEconomic observers have long known that there are no free lunches, and perhaps it’s time that electric-car fans did as well.\n\nLeftists extol Teslas and other electric cars as cure-alls for fossil fuels’ woes – even when it comes to something as simple as their tires – but disregard the tremendous environmental damage these vehicles cause.\n\nBrad Templeton, a Forbes contributor, related a story of his electric car tearing through pricey tires at breakneck speed.\n\nDespite praising the many advantages of electric vehicles over traditional internal combustion engines, Templeton admitted that the requirement for tire replacement at short intervals is an inconvenient downside.\n\n“The doozy was needing new tires at around 28,000 miles,” Temple writes in “Electric Vehicle Maintenance Is Super-Cheap, But The Dark Secret Is Tires” from last month.\n\n“That was too early, far before their rated life.”\n\n“One reason for this was a stupid mistake on my part. In the past, I’ve taken my gasoline cars in for regular service, and they were rotating my tires as needed during this service. Not taking my EV in for service, I never got the rotation done. That not only meant the drive tires of my car wore out faster, it also meant I could not make a warranty claim on them. Lesson learned.”\n\nElectric vehicles do incur charges for what is classified as a repair rather than maintenance. Many Tesla 12v batteries have been reported to fail, albeit most are still under warranty. If you chip a windshield, bang a mirror, or get a car burglary, parts for premium cars are always pricey. He admits that neglecting to rotate the tires properly may have been his fault, but he contends that the added weight of his electric car, along with the necessity for high-efficiency, low-noise tires, meant an expensive purchase was always on the horizon. Apart from that, he characterizes the advantages of owning an electric vehicle as a world of guilt-free driving.\n\nLike Pete Buttigieg, who urged average Americans to buy electric cars to avoid high gas costs while ignoring the $56,000 price tag, which has already proven to be a money trap.\n\nNonetheless, in light of this revelation, it appears that the tradeoff of electric vehicles – fewer environmental impacts for a higher price – is having the opposite effect.\n\nRegular tread replacement will have an impact on the environment, both because of the fossil fuels required to manufacture them and because wear and tear contribute more harmful microplastics to the environment.\n\nGiven that modern tires contain petroleum-based plastics, a car tire requires between 7 and 22 gallons of oil to manufacture, according to a National Geographic article.\n\nSomehow, one of these is frowned upon (tar sands), but the other three- cobalt, nickel and lithium mines (necessary for EV batteries) are “green”? 🤔 pic.twitter.com/iahDDqZRls\n\n— Patrick De Haan ⛽️📊 (@GasBuddyGuy) November 11, 2021\n\nMicroplastics become embedded in shrimp gills and guts, according to a study conducted by John Weinstein, a professor of physiology at The Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\n“Somehow, one of these is frowned upon (tar sands), but the other three- cobalt, nickel, and lithium mines (necessary for EV batteries) are “green?” Author Patrick De Haan wrote of the deadly bargain greenies have made with batteries made from land-scarred processes.\n\nWhile proponents of electric vehicles argue that they are better for the environment, it is important to remember that there is no such thing as a free lunch, and environmental costs are rising faster than ever before.",

Is this another attempt to cripple the entire food supply, including meat and eggs, so everyone will run to the grocery stores and buy genetically-mutated, lab-concocted Franken-meat that Bill Gates funds? It would appear so.\n\nNot only are hens unable to lay eggs for months after consuming globalist-manufactured tainted feed, but could it be possible those chickens and eggs are also toxic for humans to consume, possibly causing infertility issues for them also? Local egg suppliers and farmers are blowing the whistle on what could be the tip of the iceberg when it comes to corporations purposely trying to cripple the meat and egg supplies of this country, driving inflation through the roof.\n\nEver since October, several American egg farmers have experienced ZERO egg production from their chickens, until they switched their feed to a different kind, some even going with goat feed. Now, suddenly, the chickens are laying eggs again, almost back to the normal rate. What is the explanation? Chickens do produce fewer eggs in the winter due to the shorter daylight hours and molting (shedding of feathers), but they don't usually completely stop laying.\n\nWe are building the infrastructure of human freedom and empowering people to be informed, healthy and aware.

What companies are the farmers pointing the finger at?\n\nPurina's Dumor brand and Tractor Supply's Producer's Pride brand of chicken feed. These are the culprits, and if you follow the money up the line, it leads straight to the corporate gurus and globalists who are urging all humans to stop eating meat and eggs, and start eating grub worms and cockroaches, in order to save the planet from… global warming. Sure. Meanwhile, at the Davos convention, the globalists are all eating salmon and steaks. So, you were saying?\n\nIt's now more than obvious there is a deliberate war on food being waged against civilians by the globalists. Centralized suppliers, especially those that supply rural farmers that are mostly Conservatives and Republicans, are obviously out to cripple the egg supply, as strong evidence comes from two particular brands of feed these farmers use regularly.\n\nThis tragedy is forcing people to connect the dots and realize that it's not just the hen food that's causing production and infertility problems, but the human food as well. Egg farmers are now on the record saying, “If they are willing to poison my chickens to prevent me from supplying myself or others with eggs, then surely they would poison the food I eat and feed my family.”\n\nThere is a massive public awakening happening now, as food prices soar and supplies get choked out. More people are dying right and left from \"unknown causes\" and it's getting worse by the day. People are dropping dead from heart attacks and strokes and many fewer humans have been having babies over the past few years, since the scamdemic began. Coincidence? It's population reduction, and it's a war being waged using food, medicine, viruses, dirty vaccines, and supply chain dismantling.\n\nTune your food news frequency to FoodSupply.news and get updates on more toxic foods and food shortages coming soon to stores near you.",

The Department is not funding research into ‘lab-grown’ or ‘fake meat’ – nor does it have plans to include such protein substitutes in service members’ MREs,” the spokesman told The Daily Wire for an article earlier this week.\n\nHowever, there is a connection between “mycoprotein” and the fake meat. The Daily Wire reported:\n\nThe grant will, however, fund a “facility for mycoprotein ingredients,” the same exact ingredient used to create the fake meat. The Daily Wire asked the Defense Department if these facilities will be used by the Better Meat Company to create fake meat during or after the grant term, but has not received a response.\n\nFake meat has been a favored tool of globalist elites and “climate change” activists because it ostensibly creates less pollution than cattle ranching, although that claim is questionable.\n\n“Within current frameworks, governments can create clear, supportive, agile and efficient regulatory processes to ensure safe and transparent pathways that instill confidence in consumers and industry players alike, fostering a robust alternative protein market in a shift towards food systems that are more sustainable, secure and just,” a World Economic Forum report claimed.\n\nThe push for “alternative protein[s]” is to help countries reach the Paris Agreement’s radical environmentalist goals.\n\nUniversity of Southern California researchers also released a paper in August of this year detailing ways to encourage people to eat less red meat and testing the effectiveness of terms like “climate change” and “climate justice.”\n\nAs LifeSiteNews reported at the time:\n\nThe paper ultimately found that a willingness to eat less red meat fell along partisan lines, with Democrats being more eager to deny themselves the nutrient dense food, which is chock full of vitamins and proteins that aid in muscle growth. Republicans, on the other hand, were “often unresponsive” to changes in terminology.\n\nThe paper concludes that “climate change communications may therefore need to go beyond terminology.” It recommended that “effective communication strategies include using compelling everyday language, presenting clear graphs, emphasizing social norms, and making climate-friendly actions the default.”\n\nThe researchers said “conservative spokespeople” could be recruited to push Republicans to embrace the “climate change” agenda.\n\nAt the same time, some states have begun fighting back against the intrusion of lab-grown meat into grocery stores and onto kitchen tables.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed legislation in May of this year that bans the sale of lab-grown meat in the state of Florida. It is being challenged in court.\n\n“While the World Economic Forum is telling the world to forgo meat consumption, Florida is increasing meat production, and encouraging residents to continue to consume and enjoy 100% real Florida beef,” a news release stated at the time.\n\nGov. DeSantis said the Sunshine State was “fighting back against the global elite’s plan to force the world to eat meat grown in a petri dish or bugs to achieve their authoritarian goals.”\n\n“Our administration will continue to focus on investing in our local farmers and ranchers, and we will save our beef.”",

The Met Office has replied that it is unable to answer the request due to the fact that the information “is not held”.\n\nIn fact the Met Office could have addressed the claim that storms are growing in intensity by referring to its own ‘State of the Climate 2022’ report:\n\nThe most recent two decades have seen fewer occurrences of maximum gust speeds above these thresholds [40/50/60 knots] than during previous decades, particularly comparing the period before and after 2000. This earlier period [before 2000] also included among the most severe storms experienced in the U.K. in the observational records including the ‘Burns Day Storm’ of January 25th 1990, the ‘Boxing Day Storm’ of December 26th 1998 and the ‘Great Storm’ of October 16th 1987. Any comparison of storms is complex as it depends on severity, spatial extent and duration. Storm Eunice [in 2022] was the most severe storm to affect England and Wales since February 2014, but even so, these storms of the 1980s and 1990s were much more severe.\n\nAn explanation for the remarks broadcast unchallenged on the BBC was provided by the Met Office, “in order to provide advice and assistance”. The statement about more intense storms being due to climate change was, the Met Office explains, in reference to “our published U.K. Climate Projections, looking at projections in the future”. This is straight out laughable, since it seeks to justify a statement firmly in the present with waffle about future modelled projections. Paul Homewood comments that it is “small wonder that so many have little confidence in the Met Office anymore”. Meanwhile, the Global Warming Policy Foundation has demanded that the Met Office retracts the “false ‘more intense storms’ claim”. The foundation notes that there is no compelling trend in maximum gust speeds recorded in the U.K. since 1969.\n\nOf course these remarks by Claire Nasir are just the latest in a long line of scares that are being spread by state-funded operations promoting the collectivist Net Zero project. In the mainstream media there is little or no push back on often outrageous and improbable claims of climate collapse and potential future human misery.\n\nIn December, the headlines were full of the news that London could suffer an endemic dengue plague by 2060 due to changes in the climate. The claim from the Health Security Agency arose from a computer model fed with an implausible rise in temperature of 3-4°C within 80 years. Paul Reiter, retired Professor of Insects and Infectious Diseases at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, called the claims “entirely fictional” and “shameless”. Andrew Montford of Net Zero Watch commented that science is being misused to generate fear and to ‘nudge’ us in a desired direction. “This kind of shameful disinformation brings the Civil Service into disrepute,” he said.\n\nRead More: Met Office Says it Cannot Back Up its Senior Meteorologist’s Claim on BBC Radio That Storms in the U.K. are “More Intense” Due to Climate Change",

I am 15 years old, and I am a young writer and journalist. However, the Ukrainian government sees me just as one of many civilian targets in this war. In my short life, I have had to endure the horrors of war due to the weapons that Western countries supply to Ukraine. I know that there was recently an attempt on your life. I am very glad that the perpetrator did not succeed because human life is the greatest gift given to us by God. But the deadly threat that you face is the threat that the children of Donbass face every day at the hands of Ukraine’s extremist government.\n\nJuly 27th is the Day of Remembrance for the Children Victims of the War in Donbass. On July 27, 2014, the Ukrainian military launched a massive artillery strike on Horlivka, resulting in the deaths of 22 civilians, including children. Yes, the war in Ukraine began in 2014. Since then, the aggression of the Ukrainian authorities and army towards the civilians of Donbass has only intensified, which is why we want to live in the safety Russian Federation. The list of deceased children is only growing, as they continue to die due to the ambitions of adults. This must be stopped as soon as possible.\n\nIn one of your speeches to American voters, you said that you want to make America great again. Mr. Trump, the greatness of a country depends not only on the amount of weaponry it supplies to other countries, such as Ukraine, but also on whether this country can stop supplying those weapons that kill innocents. President Biden started the war in Ukraine, and now every day, hundreds of Ukrainians die on the battlefield. You may not consider yourself a friend of Russia, but I am sure that you can help bring this conflict to a speedy end. I also hope that Russia and the United States can establish a dialogue for the sake of mankind's future and the entire planet.",

The good news: most Americans still oppose ditching fossil fuels and gas cars altogether.\n\nPew Research Center published the results of its new survey on June 28. While climate alarmists’ predictions have been consistently and wildly wrong for 50 years now, with one unscientific claim after another proven false, the media, government, and institutions continue pounding in the narrative — and with some apparently considerable effects:\n\n- 74% of Americans say they support the country’s participation in international efforts to reduce the effects of climate change.\n\n- 67% of U.S. adults prioritize the development of alternative energy sources such as wind, solar and hydrogen power over increasing the production of fossil fuel energy sources.\n\nI have previously explained in more detail how “green” energy is actually toxic for the environment, besides being inefficient and unprofitable. In other words, “green” energy is a lose-lose option. Solar panels and wind turbines have killed billions of birds, for instance, and offshore wind turbines can be deadly for whales (not to mention, wind turbines and solar panels generate plenty of toxic waste). And those “green” electric vehicles (EV)? EV batteries, which have to be replaced every few years, are very toxic to manufacture and dispose of.\n\nPerhaps Americans are starting to realize that:\n\n[Pew:] Less than half of the public (40%) favors phasing out the production of gas-powered cars and trucks. Support for this policy is 7 percentage points lower than it was two years ago. And underscoring the strong feelings big changes to American life can engender, 45% say they would feel upset if gas-powered cars were phased out; fewer than half as many (21%) would feel excited.\n\nYou mean Americans don’t want to switch to unreliable electric cars that have to depend upon an already strained grid? No way!\n\nIf Pew is to be believed, however, Americans are a little too credulous of the narrative that carbon is about to make this planet into a ball of fire. (Spoiler: it isn’t):\n\n- 76% favor providing a tax credit to businesses that develop carbon capture technologies and 70% support taxing corporations based on their carbon emissions.\n\n- 61% favor requiring power plants to eliminate all carbon emissions by the year 2040\n\nOne very simple truth that the climate alarmists don’t want you to know is that carbon is absolutely essential for life on Earth. Indeed, increased carbon actually helps plants — including food crops — thrive. Human, plant, or animal, we need carbon. So drastically reducing carbon could hurt humans and devastate crops and plants.\n\nIreland to require farmers to reduce cattle herds by one-third by 2030 to save planet.\n\nFarmers to reduce carbon footprint through bankruptcy.https://t.co/YyZGxlPLNm\n\n— Steve Milloy (@JunkScience) February 7, 2023\n\nBy the way, a recent study found that CO2 emissions from fossil fuels are too low to cause global warming. That seems like important information, but don’t expect to see it in the mainstream media.\n\nRelated: WATCH: Cricketer Carries Climate Protester Off the Field\n\nIt is disappointing that so many Americans believe to some degree in the climate hoax after all these years. But it is encouraging that Americans are not falling hook, line, and sinker for some of the lies around electric vehicles and fossil fuels.\n\nWe don’t need to give up our cars to save the planet.

But as such umbrellas would be far too heavy to move even if they could be made, probably nothing to worry about. Just another climate alarm concoction in search of funding.\n\n– – –\n\nA team of climate scientists wants to launch enormous umbrellas into space to reduce the Earth’s exposure to the sun and fight climate change, The New York Times reported Friday (via Climate Change Dispatch).\n\nThe underlying idea is that large parasols could be positioned in space such that they marginally reduce the intensity of sunlight the Earth receives and thereby mitigate some global warming, the Times reported.\n\nTo block out enough radiation, a single sunshade would need to be approximately the size of Argentina — nearly one million square miles — and would weigh about 2.5 million tons, so scientists are looking to prove the idea could work by first producing a 100-square foot prototype with the help of $10 to $20 million of funding.\n\nDr. Yoram Rozen, a physics professor and the Asher Space Research Institute’s director at Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, is leading the team of scientists pushing the idea, according to the Times.\n\nBecause the Argentina-sized umbrella would be too large to feasibly launch into space, his team is hoping to build a set of smaller shades that would diffuse the intensity of the radiation reaching the planet.\n\n“We can show the world, look, there is a working solution, take it, increase it to the necessary size,” Rozen told the Times.\n\nRozen and his team are still designing the prototype, but they anticipate that they could build it within about three years once they get the required funds [Talkshop comment – of course], according to the Times.\n\nA full-sized product would cost trillions of dollars, and that expense would likely have to be picked up by many countries (i.e., their taxpayers), Rozen told the Times.\n\nFull article here (includes Mr. Burns video extract, 30secs.).\n\nPuh! and everything in the climate world is rosie\n\nand here’s another topper http://www.demolitionnews.com/2024/02/01/embodied-carbon-vice-tightens/\n\n[…] Climate Scientists Want Space Umbrellas The Size Of Argentina To Blot Out The Sun […]\n\nThis was written:\n\nA team of climate scientists wants to launch enormous umbrellas into space to reduce the Earth’s exposure to the sun and fight climate change\n\nEnergy from the sun has made and still makes life on earth possible.\n\nClearly they want to make life on earth less possible.\n\nHow a giant space umbrella could stop global warming\n\nhttps://www.bbc.com/future/article/20160425-how-a-giant-space-umbrella-could-stop-global-warming\n\nWhat could possibly go wrong? 🙄\n\nReality in a Place with lots of Sun, n’est pas ?https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/02/05/cyprus-set-to-curtail-28-of-renewable-electricity-in-2024/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_Cyprus#Sunshine\n\nI’m ‘speechless’!\n\nKind regards, Ray Dart (AKA suricat).",

ACCESS IT HERE!\n\nAmerican Interventionism Is Dangerous,\n\nBut Is It Worse than the Alternative?\n\nI’ve been here before, only I didn’t know it. When I born in the summer of 1984, the world had already escaped nuclear holocaust on a number of occasions, but the biggest close calls happened in the early 1980s, with one of them so close to a Soviet-American thermonuclear war that the Soviet officer who de-escalated the event is dubbed “the man that saved the world” – Stanislav Petrov.\n\nLike all incredible lucky stories, Stanislav was called to duty at the last second, because the officer originally assigned to the shift was sick.\n\nSuddenly, his screen was filled with notices of nuclear warheads headed to the Soviet Union from the United States, and he had to decide whether or not to call Moscow ASAP and alert them that in five minutes, the entire country would be obliterated!\n\nBut something stopped him… he began reasoning that had the United States started on the path of nuclear war, they’d launch hundreds of missiles, not just a few, and decided to hold off and learn that no other station was reporting anything.\n\nSubsequently, he learned that this was a new satellite detection system that was totally useless, and that even flares from the clouds and sun could make it beep.\n\nBasically, he found out that the latest Soviet air defenses were garbage and was actually fired, instead of hailed for his deep thinking.\n\nI was born the year after Stanislav Petrov saved the world, including my own parents.\n\nNow, the Russians and NATO members are fighting a proxy war in Ukraine. France is ready to send troops to Ukraine already and, instead of having the country join NATO, it will essentially turn Ukraine into a buffer zone between Russia and the rest of Europe, but president Biden, of all people, is the one blocking it.\n\nNo wonder precious metals are soaring, but do I agree with hedge fund managers that it is overvalued?\n\nCourtesy: Zerohedge.com\n\nIn my opinion, gold is not overvalued, and its fair price is in the neighborhood of $2,582, whereas silver’s is around $37.\n\nIn the next few weeks, Biden will realize that France entering Ukraine, while showing that Washington is playing second fiddle to an emerging superpower in Europe. Washington stands to gain much from this, as it will drastically shift from policing the world to coalizing with other nations and keeping its influence, while isolating more and more, which is a very bi-partisan strategy.\n\nIf this happens, a head-on confrontation between France and Russia will send the human race back to the WW2 era, and I submit to you that French troops will then be reinforced by German, Polish and Italian ones.\n\nUkraine, in effect, will be like the Berlin Wall, separating Russia from Europe proper.\n\nIf you’re shaking your head in disbelief, just know that during Carter’s term in office, a 40c-worth chip malfunctioned once, prompting the screens to show that 2,000 Soviet warheads were en route to major American cities. Only five minutes later, when Carter was about to be notified and we were minutes away from launching a counterstrike, the operations room called to say it was a faulty chip!!!\n\nYeah, own silver… it’s going higher.\n\nComments",

        "text": "At Last, a Credible Explanation of How Kakhovka Dam Was Blown Up \n\n by Eric Zuesse, The Duran:\n\nThough Western ‘news’ media have gotten their ‘explanation’ of this event from Ukraine’s Government, it never made sense that Russia would have wanted to flood, harm, and weaken, the entire western half of the territory that Russia now controls in the former Ukraine, including in Crimea (which was getting its water-supply from that dam).\n\nThe anonymous author of the “Moon of Alabama” website has a long and almost flawless record of accurately exposing realities that mainstream U.S.-and-allied ‘news’-media had been hiding, and the latest such is his June 13th “Did Russia Destroy The Nova Kakhovka Dam?” His report there turns upside-down and inside-out the Ukrainian Government’s ‘explanation’ that the dam had been bombed not by a missile, but by an explosive device which had been placed there by saboteurs whom Ukraine’s Government assumes were from Russia. U.S.-Government-approved ‘news’-media accept and amplify that assumption, but “MoA” does not.\n\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\n\nFirst, he quotes the New York Times and other U.S. Government mouthpieces presenting the Ukrainian Government’s ‘explanation’ of the blow-up; and then he rips it apart by noting the extremely relevant (but in U.S.-and-occupied lands ignored) fact, that on May 12th, Britain had supplied to Ukraine its “Storm Shadow” missiles that are designed to have a two-stage bombing-operation: first, a normal surface bomb, but then after it a fuse-ignited ground-penetrating bomb to explode deeper inside even a fortified and hardened underground target such as that dam was apparently blown up.\n\nThe British-supplied Storm Shadow weapon is perfect for this type of destruction — exploding from deep underground, instead of from the surface. And whereas Russia doesn’t have any Storm Shadows, Ukraine definitely does — ever since May 12th.\n\nThe present news-report about U.S.-and-allied lies is being simultaneously submitted for publication by all of the standard U.S.-Government mouthpiece propaganda-media, just in case any of them might finally want to go beyond their standard U.S.-Government-approved sources.\n\nEver since at least late 2022, Russia has been warning that Ukraine’s government wants to blow up that dam. For example, on 1 November 2022, Reuters headlined “Russia announces wider evacuation of occupied southern Ukraine”, and reported that,\n\n“Due to the possibility of the use of prohibited methods of war by the Ukrainian regime, as well as information that Kyiv is preparing a massive missile strike on the Kakhovka hydroelectric station, there is an immediate danger of the Kherson region being flooded,” Vladimir Saldo, Russian-installed head of occupied Kherson province, said in a video message.\n\n“Given the situation, I have decided to expand the evacuation zone by 15 km from the Dnipro,” he said. “The decision will make it possible to create a layered defence in order to repel Ukrainian attacks and protect civilians.”\n\nMoscow has accused Kyiv of planning to use a so-called “dirty bomb” to spread radiation, or to blow up a dam to flood towns and villages in Kherson province. Kyiv says accusations it would use such tactics on its own territory are absurd, but that Russia might be planning such actions itself to blame Ukraine. …\n\nSaldo, the Russian-imposed occupation leader for the province, identified seven towns on the east bank that would now be evacuated, comprising the main populated settlements along that stretch of the river.\n\nEven U.S.-and-allied ‘news’-media occasionally report relevant facts when they find them useful to mention in a ‘news’-report that has an anti-Russian “spin.”\n\nSo: we know that Russia’s Government was trying to protect the residents in that region against this attack, but U.S.-and-allied ‘news’-media have unquestioningly accepted the Ukrainian government’s accusation that Russia’s Government did it. And, now, an extremely likely explanation has finally been provided, which implicates both Ukraine’s government and UK’s Government as having done it.",

        "text": "The ‘Record Heat’ Lie and Marxist Machinations \n\n Is the U.S. experiencing record heat this summer? Nope. That’s just the propaganda that the climate alarmists would like you to believe. But Marxists often use global warming as an excuse to restrict liberties and confiscate property rights.\n\nData that hasn’t been manipulated by climate alarmists shows that this summer hasn’t seen a record heatwave across the U.S. There is no climate crisis, no man-made climate Armageddon, so why keep pushing the narrative? Because it’s a wonderfully self-righteous veneer for greedy, tyrannical, freedom-hating Marxism. Don’t fall for the propaganda, but be vigilant. The most vocal climate alarmists have a hidden — and dangerous — agenda.\n\nFor instance, the Biden administration doesn’t promote toxic “green” energy or target gas stoves and gas-powered vehicles to save the planet. These are schemes to make money or make citizens poorer and less independent.\n\nChris Martz of the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow’s (CFACT) posted data on June 26 to explain that evidence does not support the “record heat”/global warming claim:\n\nDespite claims from the climate spin doctors that last week's heatwave was “unprecedented,” not one state set a new “all-time” high temperature record… A total of 39 states recorded their “all-time” June high temperature records thirty or more years ago. Of those 39, 31 were set prior to 1960 and 28 prior to 1950. Six states recorded their June “all-time” record highs each in 1934, 1936 and 2012, while five were set each in the years 1919, 1931 and 1994.\n\nThe Desert Southwest has yet to see a heatwave that is as intense as that of late-June 1994. In the historical record, it remains unmatched.\n\nAs someone living in the Desert Southwest, I can add my personal vouch that we’re not experiencing record heat even within my memory. But by ginning up all this climate hysteria, leftists hope to control people’s minds and actions. The woke activists who glue themselves to streets, splash paint over historic monuments, and swear not to have children because of “global warming” are brainwashed lackeys of Marxist elites. Their life goals are all defined by politicians instead of by their jobs, their families, and their friends.\n\nLoving ‘Humanity,’ Hating Humans: Dostoevsky and Leftists’ False ‘Virtue’\n\nAnd if people are afraid, as climate propaganda is meant to make them, they are a great deal easier to control and more likely to agree with the government assuming dictatorial powers. By the way, I don’t believe the propaganda is quite as effective as leftists would like, but fear is certainly their goal. As the insidious and climate fearmongering World Economic Forum (WEF) put it, you will “own nothing, have no privacy” and enjoy it — or else. Forget the facts that increased carbon is beneficial for plants and warming makes ecosystems thrive — Marxists have a dystopia to establish!\n\nNo major climate prediction has come true in over 50 years. The lies are more ridiculous today than they were half a century ago, but they are still dangerous. We might not be facing our ultimate doom from global warming, but we could be looking at a major dystopian push from Western, especially U.S., leadership that will fundamentally transform our lives.",

        "text": "Fireworks Over Odessa Mark The Death Of Grain Deal \n\nRussian units have been carrying out successful offensive operation in the Kupyansk sector amid the inability of forces of the Kyiv regime to achieve any declared tasks and objectives of their ‘counter-offensive’ in Zaporozhye and South Donetsk. Earlier, Russian detachments also made a series of tactical advances south of Adeevka and in the area of Marrinka in the countryside of Donetsk.\n\nThese developments on the frontline took place amid the long-expected death of the grain deal under the shelter of which the Kyiv regime and its sponsors used the Odessa port infrastructure for military purposes. \n\nApart from these actions, the West sabotaged the implementation of the part of the deal related to the Russian interests. Therefore, the fate of the deal was de-facto predetermined from its very start. The recent series of massive attacks aimed against the Republic of Crimea and the Crimean Bridge became a logical continuation of this approach.\n\nIn such conditions, Russia carried out a series of strikes on military objects placed within the Odessa port infrastructure. \n\nOn July 18, the Russian Armed Forces carried out a group strike with precision sea-based weapons against facilities involved in preparations of attacks with unmanned boats as well as a ship repair plant near Odessa, where these boats were manufactured or at least partly assembled. \n\nAdditionally, storage facilities with a total of about 70,000 tonnes of fuel were destroyed close to Nikolayev and Odessa. These facilities were used to supply fuel for the military hardware of the armed forces of the Kyiv regime. On the next day, on July 19, the Russian military delivered another round of strikes on such targets. E\n\nxplosions were reported in the countryside of Odessa, including the Illichevsk port area where a large fuel storage depot was allegedly destroyed. Other sources claim that strikes also hit positions of Ukrainian air defense facilities in the Radujniy area.\n\nThe cost of the Russian withdrawal from the grain deal and strikes on the Odessa port infrastructure for Kyiv and its puppeteers already exceeded any damage suffered by Russia from terrorist attacks aimed against Crimea. \n\nNonetheless, NATO HQs demonstrate little ability to draw conclusions from observed reality. On July 19, Crimean authorities shut down a local highway and ordered the evacuation of about 2,200 people from four settlements in the east of the peninsula. The decision was made after an ammunition depot in the area close to the evacuated villages “caught fire”. \n\nReports say that the fire was caused by a strike launched by the Kyiv regime. NATO-supplied Storm Shadow missiles were allegedly employed. \n\nBy such actions, NATO and Kyiv have been consistently pushing Russia to the long-delayed but needed decisions regarding the elimination of military infrastructure in Odessa and nearby areas.",

        "text": "Math Confirms Foolishness of Warming Alarm \n\n The science of climate change often is presented in complicated language that speaks of computer models and the theoretical inputs and outputs thereof and concludes that the globe is on the verge of “boiling.” Well, leave it to three physicists -- steeped in calculus and such arcane matters as the behavior of molecules and the nuclear charge of atoms -- to simplify the analysis and arrive at a much less alarming determination.\n\n“Straightforward calculations … show that eliminating U.S. CO2 emissions by the year 2050 would avoid a temperature increase of 0.0084 degrees Celsius,” states a brief paper authored by Drs. Richard Lindzen, Massachusetts Institute of Technology; William Happer, Princeton University; and William A. van Wijngaarden, York University, Toronto. On the Fahrenheit scale, the value of averted warming is 0.015 ◦F degrees.\n\nIn short, the amount of warming averted by eliminating CO2 emissions in the United States would be too small to measure. The paper bolsters the position of those who argue that a changing climate is the product of natural forces, that human-induced carbon dioxide emissions can have only a minuscule effect on global temperature, and that CO2 is a valuable plant food and not a pollutant.\n\nRather than using theoretical assumptions about various factors that are fed into computers, the paper’s calculation relies almost exclusively on “observable data” that are widely accepted and publicly available, says Dr. Happer.\n\n“This is something anybody with a calculator can figure out,” said the scientist, who may be best known for his contribution to a laser-based technology for destroying incoming ballistic missiles as part of the so-called Star Wars program of the 1980s.\n\nThe data needed for the math are the number of years until 2050, the amount of carbon dioxide being added to the atmosphere, which scientists regularly measure, and the current concentration of atmospheric CO2, which is approximately 427 parts per million as of June 2024.\n\nThe only assumed datapoint is the sensitivity of the atmosphere to CO2 increases. The paper uses a value almost the same as one commonly used “before global-warming alarmism became fashionable.” Even if the value is quadrupled to a number favored by the politically driven Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the amount of warming averted still is only 0.034 degrees Celsius.\n\nSo, what if the entire world eliminated carbon dioxide emissions from the activities of mankind? Since U.S. emissions account for 12% of global output, the answer lies in the math to determine the remaining 88%. The paper’s calculation is that the amount of warming averted would be 0.07 degrees Celsius. Using the higher IPCC sensitivity value, the number quadruples to 0.28 degrees Celsius. Both are still inconsequential and certainly not worth destroying the world economy.\n\nNoting that others using different approaches have come to conclusions similar to the paper’s, Dr. Happer said he and his coauthors wanted to show that the controversial subject of climate change need not be complicated.\n\n“More members of the public should understand that they are being victimized by false information disseminated by those whose interests have more to do with money and power than with environmental concerns,” he said. “Answers found in relatively simple mathematics strongly suggest this to be the case.”\n\nWhatever the motivations, spending trillions of dollars to replace fossil fuels with expensive and unreliable wind and solar sources is foolish, futile and dangerous.",

        "text": "These 8 States Plan On Banning Sale Of Gas-Powered Vehicles As Biden EPA Tackles ‘Climate Crisis’ \n\n Eight states — California, Rhode Island, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, and Washington — and the District of Columbia are now on board with plans to ban the sale of gas-powered vehicles within the next decade.\n\nThe plans to phase out the vehicles and switch to electric and hybrid vehicles come as the Biden administration continues to pursue its lofty climate goals in a struggling economy. The administration, for example, wants half of all new cars and trucks sold in 2030 to be zero-emission, despite sputtering EV sales.\n\nAll 8 of the states and D.C. have adopted the Advanced Clean Cars II rule, and will have an outright ban on the sale of new gas-powered vehicles after 2035.\n\nCalifornia was the first to adopt the rule, aiming to have 35% of new vehicle sales emit zero emissions by 2026, and boosting that goal to 68% by 2030.\n\nAccording to the California Air Resources Board, the regulation overhauls the state’s “growing zero-emission vehicle market and robust motor vehicle emission control rules and augments them to meet more aggressive tailpipe emissions standards and ramp up to 100% zero-emission vehicles.”\n\nAs noted by Money, the states’ plans to ban gas-powered vehicles have generally not required votes from lawmakers, but have been advanced with support from governors and environmental regulators.\n\nThe EV market has struggled in recent months, as highlighted by The Daily Wire. Ford, for example, had to cut 1,400 employees from its Rouge Electric Vehicle Center, rolled back the planned production number of the electric F-150 Lightnings in half, and slashed $12 billion in EV investments.\n\nPresident Biden, however, is not slowing down when it comes to targeting the gas-powered vehicle industry. Earlier this month, Biden’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) set new eye-popping regulations in an effort to increase the number of electric vehicles on the road.\n\n\nThe new EPA rules set emission standards for vehicles made between 2027 and 2032 and would eliminate more than 7 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions, setting off concerns across the nation.\n\nFor example, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) railed against the EPA’s move, calling it both “reckless” and “ill-informed.”\n\n“The federal government has no authority and no right to mandate what type of car or truck Americans can purchase for their everyday lives,” the senator said. “This reckless and ill-informed rule will impose what is effectively an EV mandate without ensuring the security of our supply chains from nations like China and without a realistic transition plan that addresses our domestic infrastructure needs.”",

Zelensky while there in Switzerland pressed Ukraine's case for the need to achieve air superiority.\n\nBut Putin in his fresh remarks stressed that not only do Russian forces have the clear upper hand, but he emphasized for the first time that Ukrainian statehood itself risks an \"irreparable\" blow if the war continues. He stressed that Ukraine's military has already \"failed\".\n\n\"Not only has their counteroffensive failed, but the initiative is entirely in the hands of the Russian Armed Forces,\" Putin said in the televised remarks. \"If this continues, Ukraine's statehood could be dealt an irreparable, very serious blow,\" he added, but he didn't clarify further precisely what he meant by this.\n\n\"They are trying to show that they can also do something. But instead of solving military tasks, they act in such a barbaric way. Attacks are being carried out on peaceful settlements with indiscriminate weapons,\" Putin said in reference to the past several weeks of cross-border attacks on Belgorod city, which have killed and maimed Russian civilians.\n\nPutin further addressed Zelensky's efforts to gather world leaders for a peace summit hosted by Switzerland, to consider Kiev's 10-point peace plan, which it should be noted rejects the possibility of territorial concessions.\n\n\"The so-called 'peace formula' that's being talked about in the West and in Ukraine is a continuation of the decree of the Ukrainian president banning negotiations with Russia,\" Putin said, according to a translation in Sputnik.\n\n\"As for the negotiating process, it's an attempt to encourage us to abandon the territorial gains we've achieved over the past 1 1/2 years. But this is impossible. Everyone understands that this is impossible,\" the Russian leader continued.\n\nHe explained that earlier in the conflict, the two sides were close to serious negotiations that could have led to peace, but that ultimately Zelensky allowed himself to be the puppet of Western powers...\n\n\"A day later, they threw all the agreements into the trash, and now they are saying publicly—including the head of the Ukrainian negotiating group—that 'Yes, we were ready, but we missed the chance, because then-Prime Minister of Britain Mr. [Boris] Johnson came and persuaded us not to implement these agreements,'\" Putin said.\n\nHe stressed: \"Fools, are they not? They're admitting directly that if they had gone for it, everything could have been ended a long time ago, 1 1/2 years ago.\"\n\nLately, Ukraine has been seeking to get China involved in getting on board with its peace formula. Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff Andriy Yermak on Sunday said, \"China needs to be involved in talks to end the war with Russia.\" He issued the words just ahead of the WEF. China remains the most influential Global South country widely viewed as squarely in Russia's corner, having refused to rebuke Moscow or join Western-led sanctions after two years of the conflict. Kiev hopes to get Global South countries on its side, thus further isolating Moscow - but so far this has proved somewhat futile.",

By creating constant artificial scarcity of water through \"droughts\" (i.e., flagrant water mismanagement), the narrative can be spun that we are running out of water and thus must stop eating meat.\n\nWe are already seeing the consequences of all this green meddling in the form of sky-high food prices and food shortages, and what will soon become widespread famine and mass starvation.\n\nTruth be told, the ever-so-slight \"warming\" that one can, in a way, argue has been occurring – the earth goes through warming and cooling phases all the time, a simple fact check shows – has actually helped the planet by making it more green in a literal sense with more plants and improved crop yields.\n\nThe greenies are always lying about this, though. They want us to believe that unless we get rid of all meat, gas-powered cars, and industry, the ecosystems of the planet are going to collapse. This is a lie that must constantly be refuted, or else you had better start getting used to cockroach curry, mosquito marinades, and fly flakes in your pantry.",

According to him, the $6 million bribe that was paid in cash to shut down the investigation into the First Son’s scandal eventually found its way to the Ukrainian Armed Forces and its military-intelligence agency.\n\nDerkach claimed to have proof of the secret court order that divided these funds between those two, with the first investing its portion into building up their country’s drone army while the second financed terrorist attacks like the assassination of Darya Dugina, which he specifically mentioned in the interview. These allegations expand upon the ones that he shared earlier this year regarding the real-world impact of Hunter’s corruption scandal, which were analyzed here at the time.\n\nOn the subject of Ukrainian assassinations and terrorism, Derkach said that the CIA and FBI actually condone these actions despite their public claims to the contrary, but he warned that this immoral policy will inevitably ricochet into the US itself. In particular, he cited FBI chief Christopher Wray’s testimony to Congress last April where he said that law enforcement officials fear that Crocus-like attacks are presently being plotted against their country.\n\nAbout that, it shouldn’t be forgotten that Ukraine’s military-intelligence service GUR is the chief suspect of Russia’s investigation into what became one of the worst terrorist attacks in its history, thus meaning that the portion of Burisma’s $6 million bribe that made its way into their hands likely financed part of it. In other words, the third-order effect of Hunter’s corruption scandal is that it was partially responsible for the brutal murder of innocent civilians halfway across the world some years later.\n\nThat’s already scandalous enough, but Derkach shared even more details about the other indirect consequences of this cover-up into the First Son’s illicit activities, adding that some GUR-linked figures have been connected to the Western narrative about September 2022’s Nord Stream terrorist attack. He regards that story as a distraction from the US’ complicity, the view of which was elaborated upon here at the time that it entered the discourse, but lauded the CIA for the lengths it went to cover up its role.\n\nIn his view, the CIA might very well have sent a highly trained Ukrainian diving team to the Baltic Sea exactly as the Western media reported, though only to plant fake bombs. In his words, “when a cover story is made, it is done quite well. We shouldn’t belittle the experience of the CIA or the experience of MI6 in preparing cover operations. They have quite a lot of experience in using proxies, in using cover stories to form a certain position in order to dodge responsibility. This is actually what happened.”\n\nLooking forward, Derkach expects Ukraine to attempt more terrorist attacks against Russia, which the US public is being preconditioned to accept via the CIA’s various leaks to the media. While many might lay the blame for all this on Zelensky’s lap, Derkach believes that it’s actually his Chief of Staff Andrey Yermak who’s running the show, albeit as a Western puppet. Nevertheless, he’s also convinced that the West is indeed preparing to formally replace Zelensky, but doesn’t yet know when or with whom.\n\nAltogether, the importance of Derkach’s interview is that he’s a former veteran Ukrainian politician who still retains a lot of sources inside the regime, having served in the Rada for a whopping 22 years from 1998-2020. While his homeland charged him with treason after he fled to Russia in early 2022, which followed the US charging him with election meddling on behalf of that country in September 2020, the argument can be made that these are politically driven attempts to intimidate a top whistleblower.\n\nThe dirt that Derkach shared about Hunter’s Burisma corruption scandal, not to mention its newly revealed third-order effects that led to the brutal killing of civilians halfway across the world after part of his company’s bribe made its way into GUR’s hands, made him an enemy of the US Government. They and their Ukrainian proxies will therefore always try to discredit him with sensational allegations, but everyone would do well to listen to what he says and then make up their own minds about it.",

Scotland’s plan to implement “20-minute neighborhoods” nationwide is almost ready to launch, and have no doubts, it’s just another fancy name for climate lockdowns. No, this is not about the pandemic. This is about the governments of the world attempting to steal more freedoms and rights from their citizens, and if you believe you can save the world by staying near your home and neighborhood, then you most definitely are completely brainwashed by the crooked “system.”\n\n\nThe fake “war on carbon” includes restrictive 20-minute “neighborhoods” monitored by the tyrannical Scottish government and the United Nations\n\nIt’s documented already. The Scottish government is prepared for climate lockdowns, where their citizens may never leave their homes again, except to visit the city park (think prison ‘yard’) or the nearby convenient store, then return immediately to house arrest. Every citizen will be treated like a hard criminal, and actually really become one, if the new mandates are broken.\n\nThis is all documented under the United Nations’ “Sustainable Development Goals” umbrella policy. That’s because the “Climate Emergency Response Group” is on the scene, ready to save planet earth from the evil car users and restore the temperature back to whatever it was at before cars were invented (the same).\n\nGet ready to “decarbonize” your energy and land use, while surrendering all of your “natural assets” in ways that benefit the “communities” (big government). That’s right, the Scottish government is planning “future places” where people can walk around or drive a few miles to escape their home prisons. This is also called “local living” and “green space” under the UN goal’s documented “National Planning Framework.”\n\n“National Spatial Strategy” spells out “liveable places” and “productive places” meaning work from home and never leave, except for government-supervised local movements\n\nScotland is just a litmus test for the rest of the world. Have no doubts that once this is implemented and the populace succumbs, it will become a law of the New World Order, run by NATO police and the globalists, to keep the whole world on climate lockdown. This is not a Marvel movie where a few superheroes must save the planet from the sun’s heat bursting all of the humans into flames next month. This is reality, even though the earth is in a slow cooling phase that won’t affect humans for about a million more years. That’s why you should follow the science, not the rogue governments and their insane mandates, if you want to survive this.\n\nScotland’s Climate Change Plan is focused on achieving “net zero emissions by 2045,” meaning their economy will be completely wrecked, the citizens all starving to death, zero employment outside of working from home off a phone or computer, and total government tyranny. The “need to travel” will be reduced by 20%, periodically, until no person shall leave their home ever again, for anything, in order to save earth from global burning.\n\nNo person in Scotland will be allowed to travel more than 20 minutes from their home, and just how soon until even that is reduced to 10, 5, 1, then zero? It’s like when the governments said everyone would have to wear Covid masks for just a couple weeks, to flatten out the curve, then we would all go back to normal. Remember that? How did that work out?",

I’ve had enough and I’m sick and tired of this.”\n\nOn Friday, Newsom’s office posted on X “Big Oil has been lying to us – covering up the fact that they’ve long known how dangerous the fossil fuels they produce are for our planet.

Since the 2014 coup d’état, Kiev has been a key player in modern slavery, particularly for human trafficking and sexual exploitation networks. The political and social instability that has affected the country since the Western-led regime change operation is one of the main factors for the growth of such human rights violations.\n\nA recent investigative report published by the Foundation to Battle Injustice showed in details the seriousness of the slave trade in Ukraine. According to the organization, Kiev has become one of the main global hubs in the human trafficking market, with free exploitation and circulation of irregular workers – in addition to the well-known trafficking of women and children in the predatory sex market.\n\nThe study points out that more than 300,000 Ukrainians were victims of the slave market between 1991 and 2021. This situation, however, has deteriorated even further since Vladimir Zelensky came to power. It is estimated that since the beginning of Zelensky’s government, more than 550,000 Ukrainians have been enslaved. These numbers are alarming and place Ukraine as one of the main agents of human trafficking in the entire world.\n\nIn its report, citing sources familiar with the topic and several insiders, the Foundation exposed how the slave trade in Ukraine is not limited to the exploitation of Ukrainian citizens. Since 2021, two reception centers for refugees from Africa have been operating in Ternopil. These facilities were used not only for receiving migrants but also for selling them on the European black market. An alleged member of the Ukrainian Presidential Cabinet, on condition of anonymity, reported to investigators that the organizer of the Ukrainian human trafficking network is Ruslan Stefanchuk, current chairman of the Verkhovna Rada.\n\nIt is said that Stefanchuk is the main beneficiary and coordinator of human trafficking networks in Ukraine, working both in the sale of Ukrainian citizens on the international black market and in the exploitation of foreigners who arrive through migratory flows and are handed over to criminal networks in Europe. Relatives of the Ukrainian parliamentarian also appear to be involved in such activities, as a large network of private companies is legally registered in the name of people close to him, such as his brother, Mykola Stefanchuck, and his wife, Marina Stefanchuk.\n\nStefanchuk and his relatives’ companies have the function of disguising the slave trade, making it appear to be a legal business. Advertisements are made to “help” people in various ways, such as offering employment or financial assistance. Thus, migrants, refugees and vulnerable Ukrainians are lured into meetings and interviews by supposedly legal and responsible companies, but soon after the meetings their documents are confiscated, and these people are captured and handed over to criminal networks.\n\n“Everything is built to look as legal as possible. Ukrainian women, children and men are invited for interviews at respectable companies in Kiev, Ternopil, Lviv or Ivano-Frankivsk. They are made tempting financial offers and paradisiacal working conditions. Then, under a plausible pretext, their identity cards are confiscated. After that, they can do absolutely anything they want with them,” source told investigators.\n\nThis type of situation is not surprising. In Ukraine, several crimes are committed with impunity by high-ranking state officials. Illegal work, sexual exploitation of women and children, military enlistment of children and even organ trafficking have been frequently reported in the country. It is worth remembering the case of Vasily Prozorov, a former Ukrainian secret service agent who emigrated to Russia and has done important work exposing Kiev’s crimes. According to him, there is a criminal network of trafficking and exploitation of Ukrainian children in pedophile schemes in which Western officials are deeply involved.",

In return, the Germans should agree to resuming their war against Russia on US terms.\n\nThis was known in Washington as the M PROJECT. It was devised by a group of American co-religionists, with a common ethnic origin and a shared belief in the evil of everything Russia stood for, including their religion.\n\nThe M PROJECT was the brainchild of the head of US intelligence, the White House military advisor, and other generals and admirals.

The M&M PROJECT is due to start on Tuesday this week, according to Bloomberg. The Times of London says it will be Wednesday.

[emphasis, links added]\n\n“We are 35 years into climate alarmism, and we’ve had no global warming since 2015 despite 450 billion tons of emissions; no type of natural disaster correlates with emissions or warming; and no apocalyptic climate prediction has ever come true,” Milloy stated.\n\nIt’s time to admit the fraud.\n\n“That’s three strikes and climate alarmism should be out. But it’s still at bat and swinging because the fake news media shares its leftist agenda and will not call it out,” Milloy added.\n\nAfter all, governments can use climate change as a convenient excuse for increasing their power and control.\n\nMilloy’s comments followed the publication of a new report.\n\nThe Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), The Heartland Institute, the Energy & Environmental (E&E) Legal Institute, the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow, the International Climate Science Coalition, and Truth in Energy and Climate issued their “Climate Fact Check: September 2023 Edition.” Milloy posted the report at ClimateRealism.com.\n\nThe first myth the groups attacked was the media apocalypse prophesying on “global warming.” They looked at data to determine if September did have record heat.\n\nBased on NASA satellite data, September 2023 had the highest temperature anomaly (i.e., difference from average) on record. It was 0.9C warmer than the 1991-2020 average.\n\nIn contrast, the Temperature.global compilation of actual temperature measurements from surface stations has September only slightly warmer than the average monthly temperature of the past 8 years and 9 months, and far from the warmest month since January 2015.\n\nWhich data is more accurate and reliable? “NASA admits the surface stations are. There has still been no global warming since January 2015,” the report insisted. [That’s “because they directly measure the temperature where people reside”]\n\nIt also stated that “average global temperature” is “not an actual physical metric,” but merely a “flawed notion” used to fuel climate alarmism.\n\nThe report analyzed and fact-checked multiple media claims about the past month’s weather. Did the huge downpour in New York City break records and was it due to climate change?\n\nNo, the groups said, citing the New York Times’s records to disprove the claims.\n\nAs The New York Times asserted, is rainfall across the country becoming “more fearsome” due to global warming? The problem with that claim is that warmer air doesn’t cause “more intense rainfall,” the groups explained.\n\nAre Alpine glaciers melting at a concerning rate? Perhaps, but it’s not because of man-made “emissions;” the report noted that the Alps were free of ice thousands of years ago, and the current receding has been ongoing for years, before modern industrial society.\n\nThe report further fact-checked claims around hurricanes, Antarctic ice, emissions and the “hottest summer” propaganda, Norwegian glaciers, and allegedly human-driven global warming.\n\nIt ends by providing context to an analysis supposedly proving man-driven global warming. If you add in the warming caused by “the series of El Niños,” it’s highly questionable that fossil fuels have warmed Earth “to any discernible extent.”\n\nIn fact, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) data showed earlier this year that there hadn’t been global warming for eight years.\n\nThe “climate crisis” is an unscientific political crock.",

        "text": "Climate Expert Debunks The Climate BS In The Wall Street Journal \n\n My publisher contacted me this week, drawing attention to a Wall Street Journal article claiming climate change is producing shortages of “the finer things in life,” like wine, coffee, cocoa, and olive oil. [emphasis, links added]\n\nThe implication was clear: your carbon footprint is causing the price of these commodities to sharply rise.\n\n“Total bull-bleep,” I replied.\n\nSpecifically, the story speaks of the recent drought in West Africa, which has resulted in a cocoa shortage; dry spells in Vietnam, which have reduced coffee harvests; and parched Italian olive groves and grape vineyards, which were recently destroyed by wildfires.\n\nNone of these meteorological events has anything to do with the use of fossil fuels and the subsequent release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.\n\nThe truth is that these regions of the world are historically well-known for witnessing wild swings in otherwise natural weather patterns.\n\nAs I explain repeatedly in my new book Climate Cult: Exposing and Defeating Their War on Life, Liberty, and Property, such misinformation feeds into an elaborate propaganda campaign designed to frighten the developed world into demanding a carbon-neutral energy grid that would be about as reliable North Korea’s.\n\nLet’s begin with West Africa, where the climate periodically exhibits large spatial and temporal variabilities that allow for recurrent droughts, some lasting hundreds of years.\n\nIn fact, the past couple of years of dry weather pales in comparison to the West African droughts in the 1970s and ’80s.\n\nAs for cocoa production, a reality missing from the discussion is that global consumers are demanding more cocoa than ever, so a blip in production impacts retail price and availability like never before.\n\nThe recent drought in Vietnam is quite serious, but I’m happy to report it’s not being caused by your SUV.\n\nWhile the lack of rain in parts of Southeast Asia is the worst since the 1930s (a decade which remains the hottest on record throughout much of the world), the drought is associated with an El Nino weather pattern.\n\nEl Nino and its sister La Nina are ancient occurrences that possess the dynamics to both enhance or diminish precipitation, depending on a variety of quite ordinary atmospheric circumstances.\n\nWildfires feeding on extremely dry vegetation have certainly taken a recent toll on olive groves in Italy and drought has impacted wine production there as well.\n\nThe journal Nature recently published a study claiming, “Climate change is affecting grape yield, composition, and wine quality. As a result, the geography of wine production is changing.” However, the publication’s editorial bias seems to have caused them to ignore the historical record.\n\nThe worst drought in modern Italy occurred in the 1920s. However, going back further, that region’s most catastrophic precipitation deficiency began in the 1530s and lasted the better part of a decade.\n\nIt was so extreme that Protestant reformer Martin Luther wondered if it was a sign of the end times. Clergy in Germany, Italy, and England urged the people to beg God for forgiveness and pray for the deliverance of rain.\n\nAs I explain in my book, those pushing the climate agenda employ ad hominem arguments that appeal to raw emotions rather than intellect.\n\nAnd, as I also detail, those on the left aren’t fond of examining history. For them, Karl Marx stated it best in his 1844 book, The Holy Family: “History does nothing; it possesses no immense wealth; it wages no battles.”\n\nBrian Sussman is a meteorologist, author, and podcaster.",

        "text": "Treasury Dept Makes Rule Determination Undermining Premise of EV Tax Credits Within Inflation Reduction Act \n\n We accept the named legislation “Inflation Reduction Act” (IRA) is a legislative misnomer intended to obfuscate the true construct of the bill. The IRA was factually the ‘green new deal’ program packaged under the guise of an ‘inflation reduction’ premise. However, in order to discuss the outcome of the content we have to play the game of pretending around the purpose of the legislation.\n\nWithin the IRA there was a $7,500 tax credit for American made Electric Vehicles. The intent of the legislation was to provide incentives for U.S. consumers to purchase ‘sustainable’ and environmentally friendly electric cars, trucks, SUV’s etc made in America.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) scored the bill with this legislative intent in mind. However, the Treasury Department is now taking apart the granular details of the legislation in order to qualify foreign made vehicles for the $7,500 credit. The rules interpretation from the Treasury Dept essentially negates the CBO score, and the outcome is going to be much more expensive than initially stated.\n\nBecause the $7,500 comes in the form of a tax credit, the IRS (Treasury) is the institution making the determinations for qualification. Treasury is changing the qualifications to permit basically any EV to qualify, by parsing a difference between a leased vehicle and a purchased vehicle. Additionally, Treasury is changing the battery sourcing aspect by qualifying essentially any trade agreement as a Free Trade Agreement (FTA), saying the term Free Trade Agreement was undefined in the legislation.\n\nAs an outcome & simply cutting to the chase, EV batteries from just about anywhere, inside EV vehicles from basically anywhere, that are purchased as leases from just about any auto manufacturer, will qualify for the $7,500 credit. It’s all a shell game, with the Biden administration determining where the pea is located.\n\nDec 29 (Reuters) – The U.S. Treasury Department said Thursday that electric vehicles leased by consumers starting Jan. 1 can qualify for up to $7,500 in commercial clean vehicle tax credits, a decision that makes those assembled outside North America eligible.\n\nThe announcement is a win for South Korea and some automakers that earlier this month sought approval to use the commercial electric vehicle tax credit to boost consumer EV access. Automakers said the credit could be used to reduce leasing prices.\n\nThe $430 billion U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) passed in August ended $7,500 consumer tax credits for purchases of electric vehicles assembled outside North America, angering South Korea, the European Union, Japan and others. The new Treasury guidance does not change the definition of what constitutes North American assembly to make more vehicles eligible for EV purchases.\n\nTreasury said it was using “longstanding tax principles” to determine consumer leasing could qualify for the EV tax credit.\n\nThe IRA also imposes significant battery minerals and component sourcing restrictions, sets income and price caps for qualifying vehicles and seeks to phase out Chinese battery minerals or components. The commercial credit does not, however, have the sourcing restrictions of the consumer credit.\n\nSenator Joe Manchin, a Democrat who chairs the chamber’s energy panel, urged Treasury to pause implementation of both commercial and new consumer EV tax credits and said they had bent “to the desires of the companies looking for loopholes” and would seek new legislation that “prevents this dangerous interpretation from Treasury from moving forward.” (read more)\n\nFrom the Wall Street Journal, “One of the documents released Thursday pointed out that because the legislation doesn’t define what a free-trade agreement is, the Treasury Department might consider other types of trade agreements to expand the eligibility. The department didn’t provide examples of such agreements, but trade lawyers have suggested that the 2019 bilateral trade agreement with Japan and the World Trade Organization’s government procurement agreement could be candidates.” (link)\n\nI am reminded of the words from Democrat Congressman Alcee Hastings during the construction of the ObamaCare legislation. WATCH (10 secs):\n\n.\n\nOnce again using language to obscure reality.\n\nIt is a funny thing to see the BS passed into law and then the Treasury department”deciding” who gets the taxpayer money as an incentive to buy a car made with Cobalt mined by slaves in Africa.\n\nIndentured slaves, but non the less, it’s children doing the mining, yet it’s for the environment. I also wonder how many trans children are forced to work in this mining operation because then it would be a double tragedy for a poor black trans kid committing environmental suicide while mining the cobalt so some snot-nosed Gen Z puke can drive an environmentally friendly car.\n\nThe things I wonder about sometimes, – I know I am a racist.\n\nFunny that this is about the same amount the EV’s increased in price a few months back.",

Now they want to sell us a fake solution?\n\nTo the editor: Let’s recognize “carbon management” for what it is — a fossil fuel industry euphemism for commodifying pollution and providing life support to this dirty industry. While urgent action is needed to address the climate emergency, carbon capture is not a real solution. (“Will storing CO2 in old oil fields slow global warming? First California plan nears approval,” Jan. 14)\n\nThe process in question requires vast amounts of energy and water. The presence of oil wells and pipelines can result in dangerous and potentially deadly leaks. That’s especially true of improperly plugged wells in the oilfields that companies like California Resources Corp. want to use as carbon dumping grounds.\n\nCarbon capture and storage projects divert funds away from what is truly needed: a just transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy such as wind and rooftop solar.\n\nRather than marking “a drastic transformation for fossil fuel companies” and communities, as oil industry supporters claim, carbon management is nothing more than corporate greenwashing intended to keep these polluting companies in business.\n\nVictoria Bogdan Tejeda, Oakland\n\nThe writer is a staff attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity.\n\n..\n\nTo the editor: Let me see if I understand this correctly.\n\nCalifornia Resources Corp. wants to utilize its depleted oil fields to store carbon emissions deep underground. This company polluted California for decades, for profit, and now it wants to utilize the same ground that is basically a wasteland of little to no value to store carbon emissions that resulted from the extraction of its product in the first place.\n\nThe company made unbelievable amounts of money extracting fossil fuels that have resulted in the loss of many lives through their detrimental effects on the environment. Now, it wants to be part of the solution by profiting from the removal of the very same environmental toxins.\n\nI think California Resources Corp. could pay for this sequestration itself in an attempt to mitigate the horrid effects it’s had on the human population over the decades. But then again, there would be no profit in that.\n\nJonathon Baker, Riverside\n\n..\n\nTo the editor: Since humans are emitting 40 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide each year, it would take about 27,000 such places with similar equipment just to keep up with global output.",

Every city in the United States has become much worse over the past three years. Drive around. There’s not one city that’s gotten better in the United States, and it’s visible,” Carlson says during a forum at the Family Leadership Summit in Iowa.\n\n“Our economy has degraded, the suicide rate has jumped, public filth and disorder and crime have exponentially increased, and yet, your concern is that the Ukrainians – a country most people can’t find out a map – who’ve received tens of billions of US tax dollars don’t have enough tanks. I think it’s a fair question to ask, like, where’s the concern for the United States in that?” Carlson asks Pence.\n\nTo which Pence responds, “It’s not my concern. Tucker, I’ve heard that routine from you before, but that’s not my concern.”\n\nSeveral conservatives on social media seized on the clip, including Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, who shared a snippet of the exchange on Twitter and wrote, “Tucker Carlson just brutalized Mike Pence for prioritizing Ukraine despite a litany of social ills afflicting America.”\n\nThe former vice president shot back at Kirk on social media, sharing a clip with his full answer to Carlson that showed him explaining that under a Pence administration, the country would be able to tackle both issues affecting Ukraine and domestic problems at the same time.\n\n“Sorry [Charlie Kirk]. That is what we used to call FAKE NEWS. Here’s the full clip of my remarks if you’re interested,” Pence wrote in his tweet.\n\nIn the extended clip, Pence continues his response to Carlson by saying, “Anybody that says that we can’t be the leader of the free world and solve our problems at home has a pretty small view of the greatest nation on Earth. We can do both.\n\n“And as president of the United States, we will secure our border, we will support our military, we will revive our economy and stand by our values. And we will also lead the world for freedom under my administration.

Were that to actually happen, cafes and other eateries would no longer be able to run their businesses.\n\n\"For 35 years, we've been attacked by everybody,\" Morfogen told Carlson. \"We had organized crime in our industry in the '30s, '70s, '80s and '90s. In the 2000s, we had corrupt Wall Street, and for the last three years we've had government overreach.\"\n\n\"I mean, we've seen it during covid – they did things and never followed the science and what's going on.

Not for houses, not for farms, not for roads.”\n\n“I write this with a heavy heart, but I see no other way,” he said, adding: “I don’t expect the agricultural sector will be happy with this report.”\n\nEarlier this year, Prime Minister Mark Rutte announced his intentions to cut nitrogen emissions from livestock farms in half by the year 2030 in order to satisfy goals laid out in the European Union’s Natura 2000 scheme, which requires that all EU member-states remove industry or farming from areas deemed to be of ecological importance.\n\nThe government has asserted to meet the EU goals, some farms may have to reduce their emissions by as much as 95 per cent and that up to 30 per cent of all livestock farms may be shut down permanently.\n\nFollowing the announcement of the scheme, thousands of farmers staged protests throughout the country, with tractors being used to block highways and other critical infrastructure, and farmers dumping manure, tyres, and hay on motorways in defiance of the green agenda.\n\nSpeaking to Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM in July, Dutch political commentator Eva Vlaardingerbroek said that her country was being used as a testing ground for the World Economic Forum’s Great Reset, saying that “all these policies are out of those institutions and they are being implemented in our country first, we are sort of the pilot country together with Canada for this agenda.”\n\nVlaardingerbroek went on to claim that the push from the government to seize farmland was, in fact, more a result of the migrant crisis than the alleged climate crisis, explaining that the government wants the land to house migrants. While not widespread as of yet, this has already occurred, with the province of Flevoland buying up land in Noordoostpolder to build an asylum processing centre on the site of a former farm.",

        "text": "Why the Media Don’t Want to Know the Truth About the Nord Stream Blasts \n\n by Jonathan Cook, The Unz Review:\n\nNo one but the terminally naïve should be surprised that security services lie – and that they are all but certain to cover their tracks when they carry out operations that either violate domestic or international law or that would be near-universally rejected by their own populations.\n\nWhich is reason enough why anyone following the fallout from explosions last September that ripped holes in three of the four Nord Stream pipelines in the Baltic Sea supplying Russian gas to Europe should be wary of accepting anything Western agencies have to say on the matter.\n\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\n\nIn fact, the only thing that Western publics should trust is the consensus among “investigators” that the three simultaneous blasts deep underwater on the pipelines – a fourth charge apparently failed to detonate – were sabotage, not some freak coincidental accident.\n\nSomeone blew up the Nord Stream pipelines, creating an untold environmental catastrophe as the pipes leaked huge quantities of methane, a supremely active global-warming gas. It was an act of unrivaled industrial and environmental terrorism.\n\nIf Washington had been able to pin the explosions on Russia, as it initially hoped, it would have done so with full vigor. There is nothing Western states would like more than to intensify world fury against Moscow, especially in the context of NATO’s express efforts to “weaken” Russia through a proxy war waged in Ukraine.\n\nBut, after the claim made the rounds of front pages for a week or two, the story of Russia destroying its own pipelines was quietly shelved. That was partly because it seemed too difficult to maintain a narrative in which Moscow chose to destroy a critical part of its own energy infrastructure.\n\nNot only did the explosions cause Russia great financial harm – the country’s gas and oil revenues regularly financed nearly half of its annual budget – but the blasts removed Moscow’s chief influence over Germany, which had been until then heavily dependent on Russian gas. The initial media story required the Western public to believe that President Vladimir Putin willingly shot himself in the foot, losing his only leverage over European resolve to impose economic sanctions on his country.\n\nBut even more than the complete lack of a Russian motive, Western states knew they would be unable to build a plausible forensic case against Moscow for the Nord Stream blasts.\n\nInstead, with no chance to milk the explosions for propaganda value, official Western interest in explaining what had happened to the Nord Stream pipelines wilted, despite the enormity of the event. That was reflected for months in an almost complete absence of media coverage.\n\nWhen the matter was raised, it was to argue that separate investigations by Sweden, Germany and Denmark were all drawing a blank. Sweden even refused to share any of its findings with Germany and Denmark, arguing that to do so would harm its “national security.”\n\nNo one, again including the Western media, raised an eyebrow or showed a flicker of interest in what might be really going on behind the scenes. Western states and their compliant corporate media seemed quite ready to settle for the conclusion that this was a mystery cocooned in an enigma.\n\nIsolated and friendless\n\nIt might have stayed that way forever, except that in February, a journalist – one of the most acclaimed investigative reporters of the past half-century – produced an account that finally demystified the explosions. Drawing on at least one anonymous, highly placed informant, Seymour Hersh pointed the finger for the explosions directly at the US administration and President Joe Biden himself.",

        "text": "The Fed’s Climate Studies Are Full Of Hot Air \n\n The Federal Reserve’s credibility is in tatters.\n\nIt predicted low inflation through 2021 even as the money supply exploded and higher inflation followed. To catch up, it quickly raised interest rates, stressing many banks, and Fed examiners failed to act before depositors noticed that Silicon Valley Bank was insolvent.\n\nThe result was bank runs and panic. But instead of lowering inflation and preventing recession, many of the Fed’s 400 economists are busy fighting climate change. [emphasis, links added]\n\nExamples of climate activism abound.\n\nThis year the Fed is forcing big banks to produce complex reports on their climate vulnerability in a “pilot project” that is sure to expand and might lead to lending restrictions.\n\nA query of the Fed’s listing of recent publications returns hundreds of research papers, press releases, and policy statements related to climate change. The San Francisco Fed hosted a conference on climate change in May, in which 27 Fed economists participated.\n\nWith all this effort, one might hope the Fed would produce high-quality research on climate change. But I took a close look at two Fed studies on the subject and found shockingly poor analysis.\n\nThese studies on the effect of temperature on U.S. and world economic growth are cited without a hint of skepticism and widely lavished with media attention. I’ve managed to debunk both.\n\nIn the September issue of Econ Journal Watch, I discredited a paper from the Richmond Fed claiming that warming reduces economic growth in the U.S.\n\nI showed that the paper had serious problems with its statistical reasoning and robustness. My analysis concluded that the data used in the paper showed no meaningful relationship between temperatures and growth.\n\nMore recently I published a critique of a study from the Federal Reserve Board claiming that a year of above-normal temperatures in countries around the world makes economic contraction more likely.\n\nThe original study used sophisticated statistical techniques but failed to report that its primary finding was statistically insignificant. My request to the study’s author for computer code to reproduce the paper’s results went unanswered.\n\nI managed to write the code from scratch and exactly replicate the results, allowing me to run additional tests that the author didn’t report.\n\nThe author’s primary result—that temperature has a bigger effect in bad than in good economic times—turned out to be statistically insignificant. Additional analysis showed that there is no reliable effect of temperature on growth at all.\n\nThere are two main reasons why the Fed study appeared at first to show a statistically significant effect of temperatures on economic growth. First, each country in the sample had equal weight in the analysis.\n\nChina had the same weight as St. Vincent though China’s population is 13,000 times as large. Equal weighting means that some small countries with unusual histories of economic growth greatly influenced the results.\n\nThe paper’s results disappeared when countries like Rwanda and Equatorial Guinea—which had economic catastrophes and bonanzas unrelated to climate change—were omitted.\n\nOmitting similar countries representing less than 1% of the world’s gross domestic product was enough to eliminate the paper’s result. The complicated statistical techniques used in the Fed study magnified the influence of these unusual countries.\n\nThere’s a second reason why the Fed study appears to find that temperature affects growth: Many poor countries have warm climates.\n\nA warm climate doesn’t preclude economic growth, as is demonstrated by Florida, Arizona, Taiwan, Singapore, and several Persian Gulf states. But the average poor country is warmer than the average rich country.\n\nDebate continues as to whether this correlation is random or causal, but the hypothesis of the Fed paper is that year-to-year increases in temperature reduce annual economic growth.\n\nThe paper claims that its method controls for long-term differences in climate, but using simulated data I found that the Fed paper’s method can be fooled into finding an effect that doesn’t exist.\n\nThe only thing to learn from the Fed’s research is that climate propaganda is spreading fast, and when it comes to climate, academic economists are no more deserving of trust than are other supposed scientists and experts.\n\nThe Fed’s time would be better spent on more urgent matters, like improving its botched regulation of the banking system.\n\nh/t Steve B.\n\nRead more at WSJ\n\nJoin our list\n\nSubscribe to our mailing list and get interesting stuff and updates to your email inbox.",

Since 2019, the attendance has nearly tripled. The previous conference in Glasgow was already a record-setter, generating about 102,500 tons of carbon dioxide, equivalent to the annual emissions of 8,000 British citizens.\n\nWith the substantial turnout expected in the UAE, there are concerns that COP28 might continue this trend of rising carbon footprints at climate conferences.\n\nRichard Black, a senior associate at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, commented to The Telegraph that this event is likely to have the highest carbon footprint so far.\n\nOriginally a modest event in the mid-1990s with about 5,000 attendees, the COP conference has grown significantly, now expecting around 80 times that number. This includes both the open Green Zone, where organizations can showcase their climate actions and the secure Blue Zone, designated for official delegates and negotiations.\n\nHowever, this expansion raises concerns about the conference's own environmental impact. A significant portion of the emissions, as seen in Glasgow, comes from international flights. Additionally, the logistical needs for housing, security, and transportation for such a large number of participants add to the carbon footprint.\n\nAmid these concerns, there was criticism when UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, along with other high-profile figures, chose to travel to the summit by private jet, with Downing Street defending the decision, emphasizing the importance of strong UK participation in the summit.\n\nIt also stated that the government's stance is not against flying but focuses on investing in new technologies like sustainable aviation fuel and carbon offsetting, asserting that it seeks to lead in climate action without imposing flight restrictions.\n\nThis year, Graham Stuart, the Tory MP and Minister of State for Climate, will be heading the UK delegation at COP28.\n\nIn November, Stuart emphasized the importance of gradually reducing and eventually eliminating the \"unabated\" use of fossil fuels in the UK, while also noting that there is \"nothing fundamentally wrong with oil and gas.\"\n\nIan Miles Cheong",

        "text": "Ukraine: Western Military Backers Are “Fed Up” With Supporting Ukraine’s War \n\n\nThe West is increasingly losing patience with supporting Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky in the war with Russia. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has claimed that the West is “fed up” with the money pit that has become this war.\n\nPlus, the U.S. has now gotten itself involved in another war between Israel and Palestine, which has the potential to advance to World War 3. Speaking at a meeting with Russian presidential aide Yury Ushakov and Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, Lavrov argued that “everyone is fed up” with Zelensky, the Russia 1 TV channel reported on Sunday.\n\nAccording to the broadcaster, the diplomat quoted Romanian Senator Diana Sosoaca, who directed an angry tirade at the Ukrainian president ahead of his visit to Bucharest last week. We all know that this war is a proxy war between Russia and the U.S., so there’s no way the rulers are going to stop financially backing Ukraine.\n\nSosoaca called on Romanian President Klaus Iohannis to prevent Zelensky, whom she described as an “arrogant and unconscionable traitor, including to his own country,” from addressing the Romanian parliament. The politician further warned of “bad” consequences should she “catch” the Ukrainian president at the parliament building. “We are going to war for Zelensky’s grain! March out of our country, godless man! If you think we will sit idly by, you are wrong!” Sosoaca stated.\n\nStop The Denial: Ukraine Is A Proxy War That Will Lead To Wider World War\n\nAccording to Romanian media, the Ukrainian leader’s planned speech to parliament was canceled during his visit last Tuesday. Speaking at a press conference alongside Johannis, Zelensky insisted that he had never intended to make an address.\n\nThe opinion of Kiev in Romania has been adversely affected by the recent inflow of cheap Ukrainian grain into the country, coupled with what some see as discriminatory treatment toward the Romanian ethnic minority in Ukraine. –RT\n\nSpeaking on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank meetings in Marrakech on Saturday, Ukrainian Finance Minister Sergey Marchenko admitted that Kiev is being forced to make “twice the effort right now to convince our partners to provide us with support compared to the last annual meetings [in spring].” Part of that is because the U.S. has found another war to support, and one involving religion will be easier to escalate.",

        "text": "MSM Admits \"Magical Thinking\" Guided Its Reporting On Ukraine... Many Thousands Of Deaths Later \n\n MSM Admits \"Magical Thinking\" Guided Its Reporting On Ukraine... Many Thousands Of Deaths Later\n\nA very short while ago, any US politician or media pundit publicly calling for peace negotiations in Ukraine with Russia's Putin was branded 'pro-Kremlin' and somehow compromised. For example, mainstream media has sought to isolate and cancel thinkers like John Mearsheimer for his realism toward Moscow and the conflict, and urging immediate ceasefire which would require territorial concessions from Kiev. It was only in September that one prominent publication branded him \"the world's most hated thinker.\"\n\nBut now, at a moment Ukraine's leadership itself has become more desperate while admitting its forces are facing almost insurmountable odds, the D.C. beltway consensus has clearly and drastically changed, and now it's apparently okay to admit the following...\n\nThe War Street Journal acknowledges that the narratives it’s been pushing for months — of a successful Ukrainian counteroffensive, a possible palace coup in Moscow, a Russian economy in tatters — are “Magical Thinking.” In other words, their coverage has been a fraud. pic.twitter.com/ZxB25W61Kn— David Sacks (@DavidSacks) November 16, 2023\n\nThe WSJ piece actually calls for a longer-term strategy of confronting Russia, while also admitting that Washington's approach thus far has been based on \"magical thinking\".\n\nOr else we might just call the establishment narrative to this point fraudulent:\n\nWhat Western leaders conspicuously haven’t done is level with their publics about the enduring nature of the threat from an emboldened, revisionist Russia. They have indulged all too often in magical thinking—betting on sanctions, a successful Ukrainian counter-offensive or the transfer of new types of weapons to force the Kremlin to come to the negotiating table. Or they have hoped to see Putin overthrown in a palace coup.\n\nElsewhere in the article, the authors point out that contrary to how the Wagner rebellion was widely presented in Western press, the reality is that whole episode actually strengthened Putin:\n\nAs Russian President Vladimir Putin looks toward the second anniversary of his all-out assault on Ukraine, his self-confidence is hard to miss. A much-anticipated Ukrainian counter-offensive has not achieved the breakthrough that would give Kyiv a strong hand to negotiate. Tumult in the Middle East dominates the headlines, and bipartisan support for Ukraine in the U.S. has been upended by polarization and dysfunction in Congress...\n\nPutin has reason to believe that time is on his side. At the front line, there are no indications that Russia is losing what has become a war of attrition. The Russian economy has been buffeted, but it is not in tatters. Putin’s hold on power was, paradoxically, strengthened following Yevgeny Prigozhin’s failed rebellion in June. Popular support for the war remains solid, and elite backing for Putin has not fractured.\n\nThe tragedy is that so many people from both sides died for a year for nothing— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 16, 2023\n\nOf course, none of this has stopped Zelensky as well as his friends in US Congress from seeking to push through more billions in American taxpayer aid for Ukraine.\n\nOn a global level too, Moscow has made inroads and gotten closer with other well-armed powers who find themselves in Washington's crosshairs...\n\nZelensky has recently complained that \"Russia's goal\" to take the global focus away from the Ukraine war is working, particularly against the backdrop of the Israel-Hamas conflict and rising tensions in the Middle East. But certainly for now, Ukraine has taken a far backseat among the list of current Biden administration priorities, it seems. Perhaps indeed there's less \"magical thinking\" these days.\n\n* * *\n\nUS headlines with \"Ukraine winning\" in them, data via Bloomberg:",

        "text": "Biden Unveils Strict Auto Standards to Speed EV Shift \n\n President Joe Biden's administration announced Wednesday revised pollution standards for cars and trucks meant to accelerate the US auto industry's shift to electric to mitigate climate change.\n\nThe rules set ambitious emission reductions for 2032 but are moderated somewhat compared with preliminary standards unveiled last April. Following carmaker criticism, the final rules give manufacturers greater flexibility and ease the benchmarks in the first three years.\n\nThose shifts were criticized as a sop to corporations from at least one environmental group, even as the final rule won praise from other leading NGOs focused on climate change.\n\nThe final rules -- which were described by administration official as \"the strongest ever\" and would likely be undone if Republican Donald Trump defeats Biden in November -- still require a nearly 50 percent drop in fleet-wide emissions in 2032 compared with 2026 through increased sales of electric vehicles (EVs) and low-emission autos.\n\nThe rules, which dovetail with other key Biden programs to build more EV charging stations and manufacturing facilities and incentivize EV sales, establish the environment as a significant point of difference in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nTrump has mocked climate change as a problem and cast the transition to EVs as a job-killer that will benefit China at the expense of American workers.\n\nBiden argues that US auto builders need to take the lead in the expanding EV market.\n\n\"I brought together American automakers. I brought together American autoworkers,\" said Biden in a statement. \"Together, we've made historic progress.\"\n\nAlluding to his target set three years ago that 50 percent of new vehicles in 2030 would be EVs, Biden predicted we'll meet my goal for 2030 and race forward in the years ahead.\"\n\n- Industry given more time -\n\nEVs accounted for 7.6 percent in 2023 sales, up from 5.9 percent in 2022, according to Cox Automotive.\n\nThe original proposal had envisioned the EV share surging to as much as 67 percent of new vehicle sales by 2032.\n\nCarmakers, which are midway through sweeping, multi-billion-dollar investments to build more EV capacity, criticized the initial standards as overly-stringent. They cited the limited state of charging capacity in the United States that has dampened consumer demand, as well as difficulties in supply of metals and other raw materials for EV batteries.\n\nFollowing input from the auto industry, organized labor and auto dealerships, Biden administration officials decided to allow manufacturers a \"variety of pathways\" to reaching the standard, a senior Biden administration official said Tuesday.\n\nThis path could include a mix of EVs, conventional but more fuel-efficient engines, and plug-in hybrid vehicles, which have seen a rise in demand of late.\n\nBiden administration officials opted to soften year-to-year emissions improvements in the 2027-2030 period, while maintaining the same target in 2032.\n\nModerating the targets in these first three years \"was the right call,\" said John Bozzella, president of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a Washington lobby representing carmakers.\n\n\"These adjusted EV targets -– still a stretch goal –- should give the market and supply chains a chance to catch up,\" said Bozzella, adding that the extra time will allow more EV charging stations to come on-line.\n\n- Too many 'loopholes'? -\n\nThe final standards set a fleet-wide target of 85 grams of carbon dioxide in 2032, down from 170 in 2027, according to an administration fact sheet.\n\nWednesday's initiative won praise from leading environmental groups including the Sierra Club and NRDC, which said the new rules \"take us in the right direction,\" according to a statement from NRDC chief Manish Bapna.\n\nBut Dan Becker, director of the climate transport campaign at the Center for Biological Diversity, slammed the adjusted rules as \"significantly weaker.\"\n\n\"The EPA caved to pressure from Big Auto, Big Oil and car dealers and riddled the plan with loopholes big enough to drive a Ford F150 through,\" Becker said.\n\n\"The weaker rule means cars and pickups spew more pollution, oil companies keep socking consumers at the pump, and automakers keep wielding well-practiced delay tactics.\"",

However, service to others is but one way of honouring the whole of creation, which after all is a manifestation of the divine.

We care for the Earth for the sake of our children’s children. During my lifetime I’ve been so pleased to see a growing awareness of how we must protect the Earth and our natural world as the one home we all share.”\n\nWhat has that message got to do with the birth of Jesus and Jesus’ message for the world?

Russia eventually pulled its troops back from the capital of Ukraine. Sooner or later, however, the Russian forces will have to take Kyiv.\n\nIt will take the Russian forces more than just three days to take Kyiv. Interestingly, it was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the US Armed Forces, General Mark Milley, who voiced the \"Kyiv in three days” phrase a month before the start of the special operation.\n\nAccording to him, if the Russian forces go on a full-scale invasion, Kyiv will fall in 72 hours.\n\nNeither the Russian authorities nor the Russian military promised to \"take Kyiv in three days.”\n\nSome believe, however, that this could be real. The Russian army had already approached Kyiv when the West and Ukraine began negotiations and convinced Moscow to \"withdraw troops” for the talks to be effective. As always, NATO and Ukraine did not keep their promises.\n\nSince then, Kyiv has been keeping 120,000 Ukrainian troops in this direction in constant combat readiness. They did not even use any of those personnel for the defense of Avdiivka.\n\nUkraine is trying to play it safe — although it is clear that the Russian army is not going to take Kyiv without giving it a second thought.\n\nColonel Timur Syrtlanov, a special forces veteran, told Tsargrad publication that Russia would need to accomplish the following:\n\nThese are \"Putin four strikes,” by analogy with Stalin \"10 strikes.”\n\nRussia has combat experience that it gained in Chechnya and Syria, and the Russian forces will be \"tormenting” the enemy by working in a targeted manner.\n\nAs for the operation in the very beginning of the armed conflict, the attempt to come to an agreement with the Ukrainian authorities was a big mistake, political scientist Dmitry Rodionov believes. There were expectations that Zelensky would flee on day two or day three за the special military operation.\n\nThe Russian forces should have taken not only Kyiv, but also Kharkiv and Mykolaiv. As a result, the expert believes, \"intelligence errors led to gestures of goodwill that no one appreciated.”\n\nAll illusions about the nature of the special military operation have also been dispelled as well. This is not just a regional problem, but a period of global redivision of the world.\n\nThe West will drag out the conflict for as long as possible because it is benefiting from it. Meanwhile, Russia is developing cooperation with many other countries bypassing sanctions and living its own life, but no one knows how long all this is going to last.\n\nUltimate goals are as follows:\n\n\"It's time for Russia to take advantage of this circumstance. It is too early to attack Kyiv directly, but it is possible and necessary to split this society from within,” experts conclude.\n\nThe Russian forces obliterated a batch of 25,000 155-mm NATO shells in the port of Odessa.

False Flag Nuclear Attack in Ukraine to Maliciously Accuse Russia\n\n\nKhazarian Terrorist Group Executing Nuclear Terror Operation in Ukraine…\nAGAIN!\n\n“Looking back in history, it must be admitted that these lands are the ancient ancestral lands of the Jewish Khazaria, that is Israel, captured by Kiev’s Rus’ (the ancient state of Russia with the capital in Kiev) in the tenth century. The Slavs are temporary guests on these lands and are subject to eviction. We will return this territory, and build the Great Khazaria – the Jewish state –on these fertile lands the same way as, 50 years ago, we created Israel, squeezing the Palestinians out. Israelis will partially relocate here, and we will drive the Slavic cattle out far to the north, beyond Moscow. There will be a small Northern Territory, a reservation with a compact population — a reservation, like Indian reservations in America.”\n\n— Quote from Menachem Mendel Schneerson, American Orthodox rabbi and foremost leader of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement\n\nThe preceding quote, uttered by the most revered and powerful leader of the modern Chabad Movement within Judaism, tells the whole story.\n\nThe Ukraine War was actually started by the Zio-Anglo-American Axis to fulfill the main prophecy implied by Schneerson’s series of apocalyptic statements.\n\nWith this critical understanding, it ought to be much easier to comprehend that the 1986 Chernobyl Nuclear Disaster was stealthily executed as a nuclear terrorist attack … … … and by all the usual Khazarian suspects.\n1986 Chernobyl Nuclear Disaster:\nAn Apocalyptic Terrorist Act of Epic Proportions\n\nThe previous link contains Internet pathways to all of the conclusive scientific evidence necessary which proves that the Chernobyl nuclear disaster was carried out as a covert terror attack by the Western Powers against Russia.\n\nFor anyone who still has any doubt about this revised history, the following exposé clearly spells out the true purpose and perpetrators of that egregious crime against humanity committed at Russia’s Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in 1986.\nChernobyl was a terrorist attack.\nNow, fast forward to 2022.\n\nWhat the whole world is now witnessing in Ukraine today — in the fog of that meticulously engineered war — is yet another scheme to carry out a nuclear terror event in order to fulfill the odious predictions of rogue rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson.

Not only do the Khazarian perpetrators intend to force the Ukrainians off  and far away from their ancestral lands, especially the Russian speakers, they also want to establish the “New Israel” there as articulated by Schneerson.\n\nHowever, there is also a major strategic move, along with various tactical maneuvers, that are being made here (at Zaporizhzhia) toward the purposeful escalation of the Ukraine War into the hot phase of World War III where “hot phase” also means nuclear.",

The lies to generate fear and justify dystopia are absolutely shocking \n\n A top mosquito expert has blasted Professor Dame Jenny Harries’s claim that climate change will make dengue fever and other mosquito-borne diseases common in the U.K. within 20 years, branding it “entirely fictional” and “shameless”.\n\nProfessor Harries, who heads the U.K. Health Security Agency (UKHSA), recently said that rising temperatures will make such diseases common in the U.K. by 2040 because the Asian Tiger Mosquito – which can transmit dengue, chikungunya, zika, yellow fever and other viral diseases – will become established throughout Britain. Dengue will become endemic in London, she claimed.\n\nBut Professor Paul Reiter, retired Professor of Insects and Infectious Diseases at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, and a leading expert in mosquito-borne diseases, has ridiculed her claims. He told Net Zero Watch:\n\nThe natural range of the Tiger mosquito, an Asian species, extends from the tropics to regions where mean January temperatures are around –10°C. Northern strains are able to survive because in late summer, as days grow shorter, the eggs they lay are dormant and remain unhatched until spring arrives.\n\nIt is true that since the late 1970s, there has been rapid global spread of the Tiger mosquito to the United States, Latin America, Europe and across Africa, probably mainly via the global trade in used tyres. Professor Reiter says that it is beyond doubt that this has nothing at all to do with temperature.\n\nProfessor Reiter has also lambasted fearmongering about the return of malaria, noting that this was once a major cause of death in many parts of England, even during the Little Ice Age from the 1300s to the 1800s, and its disappearance was, once again, nothing to do with temperature:\n\nShakespeare mentions malaria – “the ague” – 13 times, so it was clearly once common here. The disease began to decline – for a multitude of reasons – in the mid-19th century, despite the upward trend in global temperatures.\n\nNet Zero Watch Director Andrew Montford said:\n\nThis is not the first time we have seen the Civil Service misleading the public in this way. Science is being misused to generate fear and to ‘nudge’ us in a desired direction. This kind of shameful disinformation brings the Civil Service into disrepute.\n\nBut it seems our public officials won’t miss an opportunity to bang the climate alarmist drum as they attempt to cajole and coerce the public into accepting radical cuts in living standards to ward off threats based solely on the perennially wrong outputs of biased computer models.\n\nRead More: “Entirely Fictional, Shameless”: Top Mosquito Expert Blasts Dame Jenny Harries’s Claim That Climate Change Will Make Dengue Fever Common in U.K. Within 20 Years",

        "text": "Trump's Seawall Is About His Business, Not Global Warming \n\n A Monday Politico article claims Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump could secretly care about global warming based on an application to build a seawall to protect a golf resort.\n\nIn reality, this only shows Trump uses global warming alarmism to benefit his business.\n\nA permit application for the wall by Trump International Golf Links Ireland which was reviewed by Politico explicitly cites global warming and erosion due to rising sea levels as a justification to build the structure. However, the application was prepared by an Irish environmental consulting group, not Trump’s business. The application clearly uses global warming to add urgency to a permit application to build a seawall which will protect his property from erosion and storms.\n\nTrump’s previous attempts to build the seawall failed to win special approval from Ireland’s national government, so his business resubmitted the application citing global warming as the motivating factor. The seawall would consist of 200,000 tons of rock distributed along two miles of beach in front of Trump’s property.\n\n“The zoning application raises further questions about how the billionaire developer would confront a risk he has publicly minimized but that has been identified as a defining challenge of this era by world leaders, global industry and the American military,” claims Politico. “His public disavowal of climate science at the same time he moves to secure his own holdings against the effects of climate change also illustrates the conflict between his political rhetoric and the realities of running a business with seaside assets in the 21st century.”\n\nThe real estate mogul has a long history of skepticism about global warming. Trump has taken to Twitter to call global warming a “hoax,” “mythical,” a “con job,” “nonexistent,” and “bullshit.” Trump also has a long history of questioning the benefits of politically popular green power in favor of conventional energy sources. He views policies created to fight global warming as hurting U.S. manufacturing competitiveness with China. Trump has also vowed to “at a minimum” renegotiate the United Nation’s December’s Paris climate deal.\n\nTrump has also expressed extreme skepticism of wind and solar power which environmentalists claim are the best way to prevent global warming.\n\n“I will say wind is a problem because it’s very expensive to build the towers, very, very expensive, and as you know when you have 40-dollar oil, it’s not economics, so they’re going to have to do a subsidy, otherwise wind isn’t going to work,” Trump said when pointing out problems with wind energy to The Washington Post.\n\nTrump even sued to prevent the construction of a new wind farm in Scotland which would have spoiled the view of a luxury golf resort he owns. Trump publicly stated he would stop development of the resort if the wind farm project went ahead.\n\nTrump has vehemently opposed wind power on Twitter, saying “nobody wants wind turbines, they are failing all over the world and need massive subsidy–a disaster for taxpayers” and asking “How many bald eagles did wind turbines kill today? They are an environmental & aesthetic disaster.”\n\nTrump’s skepticism of solar power is equally well documented, as he said in a 2012 interview with Greta Van Susteren that solar panels are “economically, they’re not good. It’s a very, very poor form of energy. Solar, as you know, hasn’t caught on because, I mean, a solar panel takes 32 years — it’s a 32-year payback. Who wants a 32-year payback? The fact is, the technology is not there yet.”\n\nTrump’s stance on solar is markedly different from that of his likely Democratic rival, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who plans to build “half a billion” solar panels. One of Clinton’s biggest financial backers, hedge fund billionaire Warren Buffett, has invested billions into building just that type of solar panel.",

He added that Ukraine may well have time to do this before the upcoming nuclear inspection.\n\nOver the last few days, Russian officials, including Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu, have been accusing Kiev of preparing a false-flag attack with the use of a ‘dirty bomb’, a device combining conventional explosives with radioactive material. Ukraine has categorically denied Moscow’s claims.\n\n“If you read the Ukrainian Telegram channels, you would see that there is a lot of fuss in the Ukrainian ruling circles now because of the campaign that we have started to launch, and there are many signs that they are trying to sort of wind down this program,” Polyansky said, as quoted by RIA Novosti.\n\nIn his opinion, Ukraine has enough time to scale back the ‘dirty bomb’ plans before the upcoming visit of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors.\n\n“They can come, but I am telling you that a ‘dirty bomb’ is not a very complex device,”Polyansky explained, adding that there is no guarantee that Kiev will not resume its alleged activity after the inspectors depart.\n\nAt the same time, the official claimed that the danger of Kiev using a ‘dirty bomb’ remains “very high,” and that Ukraine “has the opportunity” and “has every reason to use it.”\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, in a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, the Russian mission’s head, Vassily Nebenzia, said that Moscow would consider the use of a ‘dirty bomb’ by Ukraine “an act of nuclear terrorism.”\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba earlier called the Russian allegations “as absurd as they are dangerous.” He also noted that “Russians often accuse others of what they plan themselves.”\n\nOn Tuesday, the minister revealed that Ukraine had invited IAEA inspectors to come and to “prove that Ukraine has neither any dirty bombs nor plans to develop them.”\n\n“Good cooperation with IAEA and partners allows us to foil Russia’s ‘dirty bomb’ disinfo campaign,” Kuleba said.\n\nUN spokesman Stephane Dujarric, commenting on the matter, said that “all parties should avoid any actions that could lead to miscalculation and escalation of what’s already a devastating conflict.”\n\nMeanwhile, the Pentagon claimed that Russia’s allegations against Ukraine were “transparently false.” NATO General Secretary Jens Stoltenberg said that the allies “reject the allegation” and believe that Russia “must not use it as a pretext” for further escalation.\n\nSource: https://tapnewswire.com/2022/10/russia-exposure-of-dirty-bomb-plans-caused-panic-in-kiev/\n\nAnyone can join.\n\nAnyone can contribute.\n\nAnyone can become informed about their world.\n\n\"United We Stand\" Click Here To Create Your Personal Citizen Journalist Account Today, Be Sure To Invite Your Friends.\n\nHumic & Fulvic Liquid Trace Mineral Complex\n\nHerbAnomic’s Humic and Fulvic Liquid Trace Mineral Complex is a revolutionary new Humic and Fulvic Acid Complex designed to support your body at the cellular level.

According to Fox Business, the Department of Energy has proposed new rules that would reduce the current limits for water and energy use in dishwashers.\n\nThe proposed rules would limit dishwashers to using 3.2 gallons of water per cycle, significantly lower than the current limit of 5 gallons, and manufacturers would need to reduce their products’ energy consumption by almost 30 percent. Even though most dishwashers available on the market already meet or exceed the current federal standards, the proposed rules have left some questioning why the Biden administration is focusing on such regulations rather than other priorities.\n\n“Dishwashers are not the only appliances Biden’s DOE has set its sights on, however, as the regulator is also considering crackdowns on washers, dryers and refrigerators that manufacturers say could reduce performance,” Fox Business noted further.\n\nMembers of the regime have been clear: The rule changes pertain to Biden’s ‘climate agenda.’\n\n“Collectively these energy efficiency actions … support President Biden’s ambitious clean energy agenda to combat the climate crisis,” the DOE wrote earlier this year.\n\n“This Administration is using all of the tools at our disposal to save Americans money while promoting innovations that will reduce carbon pollution and combat the climate crisis,” Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm stated in a Friday news release.\n\nCritics have also poked major holes in the regime's claim that the new rules are going to save American consumers oodles of money each year.\n\n“The department estimates that consumers will save $3 billion over the next 30 years, or $100 million per year, on their utility bills thanks to the rougher rules,” Christian Britschgi wrote at Reason. “That’s a pretty small per capita savings when spread across the 89 million dishwasher-owning households.”\n\nIn fact, he noted that the new rules actually might lead to more water use:\n\nThe new regulations might lead to more water usage as individuals switch to washing dishes by hand, Britschgi pointed out, citing research from the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI).\n\nThe think tank’s proposal led President Donald Trump’s administration to approve a new class of dishwashers that clean dishes in one hour, though Biden’s team repealed the pro-consumer regulatory agenda of his predecessor.\n\nThe proposed dishwasher regulations follow a recent debate over gas stoves at the national level. Despite Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s reassurances that there is nothing to be concerned about, just last week his home state of New York prohibited gas stoves.\n\n“Nobody is taking away your gas stove,” Schumer tweeted in early February. “Shameless and desperate MAGA Republicans are showing us they will cook up any distraction to divert from real issues the American people want solved, like the debt ceiling.”\n\nThat turned out to be 100 percent false, obviously.\n\n“Nevertheless, New York lawmakers agreed to ban gas stove hookups in all future buildings in late April. The ban will affect new construction on small buildings in 2025 and move on to larger buildings by 2028,” Fox Business added.\n\nIn a statement last month, Consumer Product Safety Commission Commissioner Richard Trumka Jr., a Democratic activist and labor union leader, suggested that stoves could pose a “hidden hazard” to users and that \"any option is on the table.\" However, after receiving backlash, Chairman Alex Hoehn-Saric clarified that the agency had no plans to ban stoves.\n\nBut in February, the Energy Department went ahead with a new proposal that would allow government regulators to write energy consumption standards for the appliances, the Daily Wire reported.\n\nSources include:",

On Wednesday, at an Edmonton, Alberta news conference, she condemned a fellow-progressive, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, saying that “people shouldn’t be fooled by good-looking Liberals,” and accused him of “betraying” the Paris climate agreement.\n\nFonda claimed that, like President Barack Obama, her first impression of Trudeau was one of admiration: “When I heard that your prime minister, the shining hope at the … Paris climate talks, who talked so beautifully about needing to meet the requirements of the climate treaty, and respect and hold to the treaties with the Indigenous people, and so forth — such a heroic stance he took there,” Fonda said. “And yet he has betrayed every one of the things that he committed to in Paris.\n\n“I guess the lesson is we shouldn’t be fooled by good-looking liberals, no matter how well spoken they are. What a disappointment.”\n\nBut there was disappointment in the remarks of Alberta’s premier, Rachel Notley, who leads the left-leaning provincial New Democratic Party. She called Fonda “tone deaf” and “ill-informed.”\n\nFonda received an invitation from the Alberta government to discuss the oil sands but she refused.\n\n“I would suggest if someone was going to come to Alberta … [and] fly over a city that is going through a significant economic downturn, that’s just been through the largest natural disaster in the history of Canada, and then lecture them about where they should get jobs elsewhere, first of all, that’s super tone deaf,” Notley said.\n\nOn the first day of her oil sands protest, as she strolled through nearby Fort McMurray, Fonda was ambushed by social media reporter Robbie Picard.\n\nPicard, who hosts the Facebook group OilSands Strong, peppered Fonda with questions about the oil sands, asking her if she was aware of how many First Nations businesses have invested money in the project.\n\nThe episode was captured on video by a CBC journalist who was attempting to interview the actress. Fonda did not address any of the questions but insisted, “I’m on your side.”",

Here comes the latest Postwar Gravy Train, laden with massive government spending, lax oversight and other goodies for cunning contractors and economic opportunists seeking to benefit from the near-destruction of Ukraine.\n\nLast week, the State Department announced it intends to seize Russian assets in the United States to help fund rebuilding efforts, though the estimated $300 billion here and in Europe won’t cover the projected price tag of $500 billion. “What Putin destroyed, Russia should – must – pay to rebuild,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.\n\nLike an earlier generation of interventionists, Blinken cites the “Pottery Barn rule” – You Break It, You Own It – to explain an aggressor’s moral obligation to rebuild. Colin Powell used the same reasoning in the summer of 2002, as a \"caution\" to President George W. Bush about the consequences of military action in Iraq. A major difference is the dollars at stake. American and European firms undoubtedly are eager to reconstruct a modern, high-tech country from the ground up.\n\nOur government seeks every opportunity to impose itself, at home and abroad, but has a poor track record for managing projects.\n\nNo-bid contract awards, bribes and billions of missing dollars are the legacy of the Coalition Provisional Authority’s rebuilding work in Iraq, where officials concluded that not enough was accomplished for the amount of funds expended. We learned that when taxpayer money is plentiful, oversight and results will be negligible. Just imagine how generous and hands-off our government might be spending Russia’s money.\n\nNot everyone endorses the act of confiscating Russia’s money, pointing to the principle of reciprocity as a reason to show restraint. “Stealing” the assets of a foreign country sets a dangerous precedent that could be applied against us. For example, what if China confiscates American assets to fund rebuilding projects in Libya, Iraq or other nations the United States has damaged through war?\n\nThe DC hype-meisters talk about the Great Power Competition of wannabe superpowers; they tell us that China is on the brink of becoming the dominant international force, that Russia is preparing to seize all of Europe. Here, though, the façade falls away—the elites believe the United States has no economic or military peers. When you’re as rich and mighty as America, there’s no fear of reciprocity.\n\nThe elites will do what’s in the immediate best interest of their friends, which include certain corporations and investors who will benefit from the most extensive international project since World War II. For this group, the only morality is a morality of power: Treating other nations the way you want to be treated is a rule for losers and weaker players.\n\nBlinken and the politicians talk about our categorical imperative in Ukraine, how the world relies on America to “defend democracy” and “protect the rules-based order.” But their words ring hollow. The cynical truth is that what Russia breaks, America will take—using confiscated money to fund a massive rebuilding project that will be poorly managed, but lucrative for the chosen few involved.\n\nCitizen Soldier believes in life, liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.",

IRS whistleblower testimony in Congress under oath made it abundantly clear President Biden and his family enriched themselves at the expense of America. In short, it looks like they took treasonous bribes, and this may be just scratching the surface. How many other people in the Washington, D.C. swamp got a cut of Biden booty? We don’t know, but the evidence presented this week shows the Bidens, including the President (aka “The Big Guy”), took money from foreign sources, including China. The Constitution clearly says a President can be impeached for taking a bribe.\n\nWhile the Lying Legacy Media ignores evidence of real crime, they are reporting on the crimes being made up by the Biden Administration DOJ. The Deep State wants to jail President Trump so he cannot run in 2024 for another term in the White House. Will they use the J6 strategy that got convictions of 350 protesters at the capitol so far? It sure looks that way, and even President Trump is expecting charges soon, which is the ultimate election interference.\n\nThere is no doubt America is at war with Russia. We keep sending in arms and munitions, and there are no peace talks whatsoever. Now, a bridge linking Russia to Crimea has been blown up again, and the Russians responded by destroying a port in Ukraine that exports wheat. Higher food prices and shortages will be hitting the world soon. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar is under attack, and a new global currency is going to be released by the so-called BRICS countries.

This included export restrictions imposed on nearly 100 firms or individuals.\n\n\"The American people and people around the world understand that the stakes of this fight extend far beyond Ukraine,\" President Biden said in a statement which first unveiled the planned sanctions. \"If Putin does not pay the price for his death and destruction, he will keep going.

If Putin does not pay the price for his death and destruction, he will keep going.\"\n\nAs for \"paying the price\" - just as Biden issued these words, The Wall Street Journal observed that two years after the invasion, the \"biggest ever\" sanctions are failing and have failed:\n\nTwo years after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Western sanctions have failed in their most important task—stopping the Kremlin’s war machine.\n\nWestern officials and experts say the financial, economic, military and energy sanctions imposed on Russia since February 2022 have damaged Russia’s economy and arms-production capacity, and will create serious problems for the Kremlin in the coming years. But they acknowledge the restrictions have hit more slowly than they hoped.\n\nThe report further acknowledges the merely symbolic nature of the new sanctions: \"U.S. officials privately concede that the new measures set to to be announced Friday are likely to land a limited blow.\"\n\nCould a future Trump administration make a U-turn on the Russia sanctions as part of potential negotiations to end the war?\n\n🇪🇺🇺🇦 - @ecfr data show Europeans are pessimistic about Ukraine's ability to win war— Agathe Demarais (@AgatheDemarais) February 21, 2024\n\n• Just 10% of Europeans believe Kyiv will win the war; twice as many think Russia will win\n\n• Trump 2.0 scenario may be greatest risk for Ukraine, as it could entail US U-turn on Russia sanctions pic.twitter.com/C4F5MBwVs1\n\nIn tandem, the EU also announced a new round of sanctions. \"Today, we are further tightening the restrictive measures against Russia’s military and defense sector,\" EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell stated. \"We remain united in our determination to dent Russia’s war machine and help Ukraine win its legitimate fight for self-defense.\"\n\nThe EU sanctions target 106 more officials and nearly 90 entities that include companies, banks, and government agencies.

Such an operation could take the form of a faked attack, a staged ‘discovery’ of agents or munitions, or fabricated evidence of alleged Ukrainian planning to use such weapons,” officials said, adding that such a “false-flag” attack would “almost certainly be accompanied by extensive disinformation to complicate attribution.”\n\nOfficials added that intelligence suggests that Moscow had likely intended to use false-flag operations as justification for its invasion of neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24.\n\nHowever, analysts believe that the narrative is part of the Kremlin’s plan to create a false-flag operation in an attempt to justify using chemical weapons operations in Ukraine itself.\n\nYet both the United States and Ukraine maintain that the laboratories seek to prevent bioweapons and pathogens, a project backed by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, an agency within the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD).\n\nIn response to Russia’s allegations, State Department spokesman Ned Price said in a statement that the disinformation being spread by Russia is “total nonsense and not the first time Russia has invented such false claims against another country.”\n\nThe UK Ministry of Defence’s report comes as NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned on March 13 that the Kremlin might use chemical or biological weapons in its invasion of Ukraine, which would amount to a war crime.\n\nThe NATO Secretary General echoed comments by the UK’s Ministry of Defense that Russia could be using the claims to create a false pretext to justify its actions.\n\n“Now that these false claims have been made, we must remain vigilant because it is possible that Russia itself could plan chemical weapons operations under this fabrication of lies. That would be a war crime,” Price said.",

Andy Barr of Kentucky, a member of the House Financial Services Committee, said that investigating the Biden administration and Wall Street’s use of environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) principles will be a major focus of his committee if Republicans gain a majority in the House on Nov. 8, according to The Washington Post. The lawmakers argue that large financial institutions have withheld investment from businesses that they don’t consider to be eco-friendly based on their ESG criteria. (RELATED: Kentucky Officials Demand Proof That State Pension Funds Aren’t Used For Woke Investing)\n\n“My view is that ESG investing is a cancer within our capital markets,” Barr told the Post. “It is a fraud on American investors.”\n\nBarr and other Republicans hope to force SEC Chairman Gary Gensler to answer questions on the agency’s proposed climate disclosure rule, which would require all publicly traded companies to disclose their carbon emissions and climate change risks, the Post reported. The rule could allow climate-focused investors to more easily discern the “climate risks” of certain businesses and pressure them to become more eco-friendly.\n\nRepublican Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska introduced a bill in May to combat major investors’ influence and will continue discussing such actions with industry executives, his spokesman told the Post.\n\n“We’ve become the loud noise in their right ear after all the screaming in their left ear,” Republican Senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota said about GOP efforts to push back against Wall Street firms’ climate-focused investment strategies, according to the Post.\n\nRepublican Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer of Missouri and ranking member on the Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Financial Institutions told the Post that he wants to force BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street executives to testify in front of the financial services committee as the three massive money managers have used their financial influence to push companies to adopt their climate agenda and other political movements.\n\nBlackRock, which manages nearly $8 trillion in assets, has been scrutinized by Republican attorneys general and state treasurers over its alleged failure to place the interests of its investors above the firm’s stance on climate change.\n\nThe Republicans are expected to take back the House in the midterm elections and will hold a majority in the House Financial Services Committee as well as other committees that can be used to probe the SEC, banks and asset managers.",

Review of the Evidence \n\n by Prof Michel Chossudovsky, Global Research:\n\nEight years ago, on 17 July 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 (MH17) was shot down in Eastern Ukraine.\n\nIn recent development, A Netherlands Court on November 17, 2022 found the Kremlin responsible for the alleged attack: two Russians and\n\na separatist Ukrainian” were identified as “guilty of mass murder for their involvement in the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17”.\n\nThe media has highlighted the downing of MH17 in the context of the war in Ukraine. The Court ruling is fraudulent, based on fabricated evidence.\n\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\n\n***\n\nThis background text was prepared in the context of the Kuala Lumpur MH17 Conference entitled MH17: The Quest for Justice, organized by JUST, the PGPF and the CRG in August 2019.\n\nThis comprehensive report provides detailed evidence that Russia was not involved in the downing of MH17.\n\nIt also confirms the insidious role of Ukraine’s intelligence agency.\n\n****\n\nThe underlying objective is to examine the evidence, reveal the truth and uphold the rule of law.\n\nToday, July 29th 2021, our thoughts are with the families of the victims of the Malaysian Airlines MH17 tragedy.\n\nThe 2019 Conference was dedicated to the memory of the victims.\n\nIt is also a national tragedy for the people of Malaysia. The downing of MH17 with 283 passengers and 15 crew on board, took place barely a few months following the mysterious disappearance of Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 after departing on March 8, 2014 from Kuala Lumpur for Beijing, with 227 passengers and 12 crew members on board.\n\nIt is worth recalling that immediately after the MH17 plane crash on July 17 2014, prior to the conduct of a preliminary investigation, Secretary of State John Kerry and US Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power pointed their finger at Moscow without a shred of evidence. In turn, the allegations directed against Russia were used to justify the imposition of sweeping economic sanctions against the Russian Federation.\n\nAccording to President Obama (hours after the tragedy):\n\n“… the downing of MH17 should be “a wake-up call” to Europe to get serious about confronting Russia over Ukraine after EU leaders have proved reluctant to impose tought sanctions.” (Telegraph, July 18,2019)\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports (July 18, 2014) that “Obama is getting his wish and Brussels is now weighing new sanctions”:\n\nEuropean governments, jolted by the downing of a passenger plane over eastern Ukraine that killed nearly 300 people, are contemplating a major expansion of sanctions on Russia as early as next week.\n\nEuropean Union leaders decided in recent days to expand the penalties to a broad new category of people and companies. But the apparent shooting down of a plane carrying more than 200 EU citizens has intensified a desire to act quickly and forcefully, including sanctions against oligarchs with ties to the Kremlin.\n\nIn Brussels, some diplomats described the incident as a game-changer. “It would have major consequences if it was certain it came from the rebels— major consequences,” said one official. (WSJ, July 18, 2014)\n\nOn July 22, 2014, The European Union decided to expand its sanctions blacklist against Moscow including Vladimir Putin’s inner circle.\n\nEU foreign ministers decided to “draw up further broad measures including an arms embargo and financial restrictions on Russian businesses, … following the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17.” (Guardian, July 22, 2019)\n\nMichel Chossudovsky, August 2019, updated July 17, 2020, July 16, 2022",

This coincided with Biden banning mining in the Iron Range in northeastern Minnesota, which is marked by four major iron ore deposits. (Related: FORCE MAJEURE: Massive global shutdowns are now under way for METALS SMELTING operations covering iron, copper, nickel, aluminum, zinc and STEEL.)\n\nAccording to Alpha News, the bill on the mining ban got passed after seven hours of debate with the Republicans, who offered several amendments to make the timeline more manageable but got rejected.\n\nThe junked amendments included \"lifting the state’s moratorium on new nuclear power plants; allowing for the use of carbon sequestration technologies; and delaying the standard to consider its impact on child and slave labor in the green energy supply chain.\"\n\nRep. Spencer Igo (R-Wabana Township) said at a press conference ahead of the debate that the bill will make \"Minnesota reliant on nations around the globe that have no labor standards and no environmental standards. Minnesota in this bill will build a clean grid economy on the backs of child slaves in China and poor environmental regulations in Indonesia and the Congo.\"\n\nIgo lamented that the resources to build a clean energy future are right there in Minnesota, which leads the nation in iron ore production, but the federal government opted to ban mining in the state.\n\n\"The third-largest deposits of copper, nickel and cobalt that exist in the known world are only 250 miles north of this Capitol. Instead of investing in those resources … we have decided to export it around the world where carbon emissions will be 20, 25 or 30 times higher than if we were to do it here in Minnesota,\" Igo said.\n\nSecretary of the Interior Deb Haaland signed Public Land Order 7917, which withdraws around 225,504 acres of land in the Superior National Forest in northeastern Minnesota from mineral leasing, according to a Jan. 26 press release.\n\nThe move drew criticism from mining associations and lawmakers who believe mining is necessary for the country's mineral security and could harm the interests of Twin Metals, a major mining company that seeks to build an underground mine in Ely, a small city in Saint Louis County, Minnesota.\n\nRep. Pete Stauber (R-Minn.), who represents the region where a proposed copper-nickel mine was to be set up by Twin Metals, called the Biden administration's decision \"an attack on our way of life.\"\n\nMeanwhile, National Mining Association CEO Rich Nolan said the decision is \"nonsensical\" considering that the U.S. is looking to be a \"leader in manufacturing, innovation and climate.\"\n\nAccording to Nolan, the government has imposed the mining moratorium at a time when the demand for minerals like nickel, cobalt and copper is \"skyrocketing\" because of their \"widespread application in solar and wind infrastructure as well as electric vehicles.\"\n\nNolan pointed out that these lands could provide U.S. manufacturers with \"plentiful sources\" of minerals apart from providing high-paying domestic jobs. Further, the country is losing out on mining operations that would have been implemented in compliance with environmental and safety regulations.\n\nOf course, these observations wouldn't be heeded by Biden and the Democrats. They want to flaunt their power with no regard for what is truly beneficial for the Minnesotans and Americans in general.\n\nWatch the video below discussing Britain's approval of its first new coal mine in decades despite its climate targets.\n\nThis video is from the Iron Age News channel on Brighteon.com.\n\nBiden threatens oil firms: Do something about rising gas prices or face consequences.\n\nBiden and Harris blatantly lied when they said before the election they would not ban fracking.\n\nThe SHUTDOWNS continue in 2022: Aluminum, copper, iron, steel production being shuttered at alarming rate.\n\nSources include:",

He didn’t inherit an economic catastrophe. He inherited an economy that was growing above six percent. He inherited an economic boom. So, everything since then has been a lie.”\n\n“We got inflation because they lied that we were in an economic catastrophe, so they overspent,” he continued. “So, of course, right now you’re thinking, ‘Why can’t I make sense of this?’ It’s because it’s just lies.”\n\nCarney then zeroed in on Biden’s “middle out and bottom up” claim.\n\n“Nobody I’ve talked to can explain what ‘from the bottom up and the middle out’ means at all,” he said. “And that’s also not what they’re doing. When they are having government-directed money flowing into the economy—you know, all the subsidies for the Green New Deal stuff—that’s not from the bottom up. That’s the top down.”\n\n“It’s a grift,” Kudlow added. “It’s money to donors, campaign donors. It’s money to big corporations who buy into their DEI and climate change stuff. It’s money to Democratic interest groups city by city, state by state. You are so right. It’s totally top down.”\n\n“It’s not working either, because the American people are rejecting it all of the time. Whenever you see polls, they say they don’t trust Biden,” Carney noted.\n\nAn AP-NORC poll released this week found that 69 percent of Americans believe Biden’s economy is “poor,” and 64 percent disapprove of his management of the economy.\n\nCarney also commented on Friday’s jobs report from the U.S. Labor Department, noting that despite the numbers coming in under expectations, the report “almost guarantees two more hikes” from the Federal Reserve.\n\nHe made this same point in Friday’s Breitbart Business Digest, explaining that the June jobs report and data showing a 4.4 percent year-over-year growth in average hourly wages “are likely enough to lock-in a rate hike at the end-of-the-month Federal Open Market Committee meeting and tilt the balance in favor of another rate hike in September.”\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.",

America is planning ultimately to invade Russia from the only nation that is only 300 miles away from Moscow (Russia’s central command — far closer than Cuba was to Washington DC during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis).\n\nHere, as proven in the links, are the historical facts, documenting the U.S. Government’s increasing aggression against Russia — using Ukraine as its primary springboard in its plan to conquer Russia:\n\nThe Obama Administration perpetrated in February 2014 a bloody Ukrainian coup (hidden behind popular anti-corruption Ukrainian demonstrations that the CIA and State Department had trained and organized local racist-fascist anti-Russian Ukrainians to lead) overthrowing the democratically elected President of Ukraine and replacing him by a racist-fascist (ideologically nazi) regime that immediately replaced Ukraine’s generals with ones to ethnically cleanse pro-Russian Ukrainians and kill some and terrorize the others to flee into Russia so as to get rid of the people in the Ukrainian regions that had voted 70% or more for that democratically elected President — and this ethnic cleansing would enable the nazi U.S.-installed regime in Ukraine to be ‘democratically elected’, and so to continue the U.S.-Government’s control over that country, on Russia’s border.\n\nFor the full details, see this.\n\nSo: all three of those phrases (“Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine”, “unprovoked war in Ukraine”, and “Russian aggression against Ukraine”) are lies, which reverse the aggressor (purportedly Russia, but actually America) and the defender (purportedly Ukraine — which is America’s proxy in its war against Russia — but actually Russia).\n\nThe war in Ukraine started with Obama’s coup, not with Putin’s ultimate response to it (which occurred soon after America’s rejection on 7 January 2022, of Russia’s demand, NOT to allow Ukraine into NATO).\n\nAmerica’s plan here is to place its missiles on Ukraine’s border with Russia, only a five-minute-missile-flight away from blitz-nuking The Kremlin and thereby beheading Russia’s central command — too fast for Russia to be able to launch its retaliatory missiles.\n\nWhat is the power of lies?\n\nIn a U.N.

        "text": "The Laughing Stock of COP28 – How the UAE Event Became a Farce \n\n\nIt was always going to be a balancing act keeping the credibility of the global environmental talk shop COP28 in check while holding it in a country where they are producing fossil fuels like it is going out of fashion. It might not have been a wise choice of the UAE’s president Mohamed Bin Zaid to give the top job of presiding over the event to the oil minister and the boss of the national oil company, but it was equally unwise for Sultan al-Jabar to have used the event as a way of promoting the UAE and its oil production to other countries. Something about that smacks of shooting yourself in the foot and perhaps Mr Al Jabar’s denials and feigned innocence at the opening day press conference just made the whole fiasco even more of a farce than it already was.\n\nThe UAE tycoon just lowered himself into the vat of sulphuric acid when – in media terms – he couldn’t pull off the ultimate stunt that all politicians dream of but very few actually achieve: to lie to the press and get away with it.\n\nLazy journalists might have just left it at that. But then they started to look more closely at Mr Al Jaber who had paid Lynton Cosby, the infamous Australian media and political consultant to handle all the PR for the event – and decided that the Emirate minister’s unchecked, feral speaking needed a closer look. It didn’t take much digging to find even more controversy days earlier when he more or less mocked the science behind climate change in defence of fossil fuels, leading many to ask how did the UAE get this gig in the first place and couldn’t its elite have chosen someone with more media elan?\n\nThe failure of the event can really be determined by how media were mismanaged from the beginning when the early signs were there back in January when the Guardian launched its first attack against Mr Al Jaber questioning his credentials. That might have been a good indicator that Jaber and his team needed to listen and learn with a serious of crisis management media training sessions which Mr Cosby should have set up and wheeled in the grey haired retired journalists in London to help with the dummy interviews. But presumably, being someone who has enjoyed silencing the press – the UAE has probably one of the most servile press in the world, often with media outlets running front page stories about the elite opening a shopping mall or just repeating one of their tweets – it was little surprise that Jaber believed that the world’s press wouldn’t turn against him. The old story that when you mess up media, you become the story, became the story. Jaber, within a matter of hours, became the focus of attention by journalists who were the to find a good story and didn’t find one from the organised conferences and hullabaloo.\n\nThe UAE needs to think much more about international media if it is going to court the attention of the world. Its elite need to wake up and realise that international press whose journalists fly in and leave a few days later are working from a very different hymn sheet than the local expats who work for The National, which despite huffing and puffing and blowing hot for Jaber right from the beginning made no impact whatsoever on global opinion which has written off the event as an unprecedented PR disaster. Indeed, it was Yanis Varoufakis, a media darling and former Greek Finance minister who put it so succinctly on Twitter:\n\n“UN Chief denounces COP28’s President. What did they expect? Appointing Sultan al-Jaber, the head of UAE’s oil company, as Head of COP28 was like appointing the leader of a pack of wolves to preside over a conference on making the world vegan”. The UAE doesn’t have a satire magazine like Private Eye so we won’t pity those who were robbed of the opportunity to lay on the irony hard and thick. But the lessons are there for the royals of the UAE who must be dumbfounded by the calamity of the event and just how much the whole event has become an international laughing stock. Perhaps think about media more next time?",

The West will put pressure on Kiev, calling for an end to the conflict, even if US presidential candidate Donald Trump loses the election. This was reported by the Financial Times (FT) newspaper.\n\nAccording to her, Kiev knows that it will be under increasing pressure to achieve negotiations on ending the conflict. And this will happen regardless of whether Trump wins the election, the publication emphasizes.\n\nThe former US president has repeatedly stated that he is able to achieve peace in Ukraine overnight, but did not specify exactly how. But several of his former officials and advisers have suggested that this could include an unofficial cession of territory in exchange for meaningful Western security guarantees for Kiev, writes FT.\n\nUkraine and several of its European allies are concerned about this course of events, but with the current level of Western military support and internal mobilization of Ukraine's resources, Kiev has no viable path to victory, the publication emphasizes. Europe has no desire to step up its efforts. Although the Europeans \"recognize\" that more will have to be done to arm Ukraine, \"there is no substantive discussion of options,\" the FT quoted a senior European official as saying.\n\nOn June 14, Russian President Vladimir Putin, at a meeting with the leadership of the Foreign Ministry, named the conditions for resolving the situation in Ukraine. Among them are the withdrawal of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) from Donbass and Novorossiya, Kiev's refusal to join NATO. In addition, Russia considers it necessary to lift all Western sanctions against it and establish Ukraine's non-aligned and nuclear-free status. Kiev rejected the Russian peace plan. After the massive attack by the Ukrainian Armed Forces on the Kursk region, which began on August 6, the Russian leader said that negotiations with the government attacking civilians were pointless.",

Since the growth factors don’t last long in the cell culture media, they also have to be replenished every few days. This limits the ability to provide an affordable product to consumers. Taking that ingredient out of the growth media leads to an enormous cost savings.\"\n\nIn other words, the real beef industry is being attacked on all sides with mysterious fires and lawsuits while the emerging synthetic beef industry is making major strides in reducing production costs.

It is still capable of producing missiles, doing evasion of sanctions…And we especially need air defense systems.\"\n\nWithout doubt, the Zelensky admin is in damage control after eyebrow-raising comments were issued to The Economist early this month by Ukraine's top commander, who admitted there will be no breakthrough and the battlefield situation is in a stalemate.

That's exactly what we're doing.'\n\nIt comes as the head of Kyiv's national security council said Putin could demand a tactical nuclear weapon be used if Russia's army is beaten in Ukraine.\n\nOleksandr Lytvynenko made the comments after G7 leaders warned any use by Russia of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons would be met with 'severe consequences', The Times reported.\n\nJens Stoltenberg (pictured), the 13th secretary general of NATO, revealed there were live discussions among members about removing missiles from storage and putting them on standby\n\nA Netherlands' Air Force F-16 jetfighter takes part in the NATO exercise as part of the NATO Air Policing mission\n\nThe head of Kyiv 's national security council said Putin could demand a tactical nuclear weapon be used if Russia's army is beaten in Ukraine\n\nRussian soldiers load a Iskander-M short-range ballistic missile launchers at a firing position as part of Russian military drill intended to train the troops in using tactical nuclear weapons\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Stoltenberg warned in Brussels of the threat from China, adding that nuclear transparency should form the basis of Nato's nuclear strategy to prepare the alliance for the dangers of the world.\n\n'Nato's aim is, of course, a world without nuclear weapons, but as long as nuclear weapons exist, we will remain a nuclear alliance, because a world where Russia, China and North Korea have nuclear weapons, and Nato does not, is a more dangerous world,' he said.\n\nMr Stoltenberg claimed that China is heavily investing in modern weaponry, which includes its nuclear arsenal, which the secretary general said would increase to 1,000 possibly by 2030.\n\nHe insisted the US and its European allies are modernising their nuclear deterrent as a result of heightened threat from Russia.\n\n'The US is modernising their gravity bombs for the nuclear warheads they have in Europe and European allies are modernising the planes which are going to be dedicated to Nato's nuclear mission,' he said.\n\nIt comes as Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky yesterday accused Russia of not wanting peace, after Putin said he would only accept a ceasefire if Ukraine agreed to halt its NATO ascension plans.\n\nZelensky made the accusation at the end of a major diplomatic summit in Switzerland, which more than 90 countries attended, making it the largest gathering in support of Ukraine since the start of the invasion.\n\nThe conference saw the vast majority of the 90 nations who attended sign a communique in support of Ukraine sovereignty, and also called for Putin to return children stolen during the invasion.",

Period full stop. That was a single, clear sentence. It’s not subject to negotiation from any country, including Russia.",

Many of these activist hubs are being bankrolled by Climate Emergency Fund, a Beverly Hills-based charity linked to Hollywood celebrities and top liberal nonprofit organizations aiming to shape the Democratic Party’s agenda, according to tax forms and other documents reviewed by the Washington Examiner.\n\n“Climate Emergency Fund has quickly become the ATM that radical environmental activists turn to fund their latest disruptions,” Caitlin Sutherland, executive director of the conservative watchdog Americans for Public Trust, told the Washington Examiner. “And as their destruction increases, so should the scrutiny on who is bankrolling the Climate Emergency Fund and their ties to more mainstream environmental groups that might disagree with these over-the-top and dangerous tactics.”…\n\nAnd, unlike the typical run-of-the-mill charity, CEF boasts a star-studded cohort of financial backers and board members, including Rory Kennedy, daughter of the late senator Robert F. Kennedy, Aileen Getty, the billionaire philanthropist and heiress of the Getty family fortune earned in the petroleum industry, and even Hollywood’s Adam McKay, who pledged it $4 million in September 2022 and directed the 2021 climate allegory film Don’t Look Up.\n\nCEF celebrity funders also include Jeremy Strong, who plays Kendall Roy in the HBO TV series Succession, comedian Chelsea Handler, actor and Silicon Valley star Thomas Middleditch, and Abigail Disney, daughter of ex-Disney executive Roy E. Disney, according to CEF’s annual 2022 report.\n\nTake a bow, Hollywood liberals.

I’m really just giving the broad strokes, and giving people a basis upon which they can do further investigation into what is going on if they are so inclined.\n\nIf readers find the coverage boring, they can skip over it. There is a lot of other stuff on this site. I am covering the Ukraine the exact right amount. I am obligated to do this because so few outlets are covering the war with any truth or honesty. In the English language, the pro-Russia perspective is very difficult to find, with most conservatives who are against the war simply saying that they don’t care either way. “I do care and I actively support those fighting against the Washington and Brussels elite” is an important perspective that must be in the public conversation.\n\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\n\nMitch McConnell was right when he said the most important thing happening in the world is the Ukraine conflict. He was right for the wrong reasons, but he was right.\n\nAmerica Last pic.twitter.com/WKAxPgvHTX\n\n— Alex Stein #99 (@alexstein99) May 11, 2022\n\nSomeone is going to win this conflict, and someone is going to lose. The stakes could not be any higher. The future of the entire world now hinges on the outcome of this conflict. This is the single most consequential military conflict in all of human history.\n\nIf Russia loses, the Putin government will collapse, and the US will be able to steamroll the country, break it apart into several pieces. From there, the US will have China isolated, and then eventually break them. This will result in the final establishment of a singular world order run by the Jewish power centers in the United States, Europe, and Israel.\n\nIf the US loses the war, we are looking at a freefall collapse of the Western economic and military order, a rising China, and a reshuffling of the entire order of power on the planet earth.\n\nThe reason I support Russia is that I want the US empire to collapse. The reason I want the US empire to collapse is that I do not believe that the US empire is compatible with freedom in the US, and believe that we can only reestablish freedom in this country when the empire falls.\n\nIf the dollar goes down and the US can no longer export debt to the world through the dollar reserve system, the US government will no longer have the ability to micromanage the lives of American citizens. They will not have the resources (you have to have a lot of excess money to inflict your will on the entire population, which is one reason why people are so much freer in third world countries). We will be free, and we will then be able to return to the natural order in our society, without Jews controlling everything, without trannies, without deadly fake vaccines, without mass immigration, without feminism.\n\nThose are the stakes.",

If that is achieved, then the Big Three can stay open until 2049.\n\nAfter that, the report states, all airports, including the Big Three, will need to be closed down permanently, leaving residents trapped right where they are. This, we are told, will \"cool\" down the planet and create a climate utopia.\n\n\"In order to meet this legal commitment, the report states that every citizen of the United Kingdom will need to 'stop using aeroplanes' for a significant period of time,\" reported The Exposé about how the scheme is outlined to work.\n\nIn order to fully comply with the Climate Change Act, airports are not the only thing that has to go. The same report states that the general public will need to stop flying as well as stop doing anything else that creates \"emissions,\" regardless of the energy source.\n\nMeat consumption, for instance, will also need to end because raising cows for beef and sheep for lamb is bad for the environment, the globalists claim. Genetically modified (GMO) soybeans and corn, on the other hand, which have to be doused in deadly chemicals in order to grow, are good for the environment and can stay.\n\nBy 2029, these climate extremists want people in the UK to reduce their meat consumption by 50 percent. The remaining 50 percent will need to be \"phased out\" between 2030 and 2049.\n\nNo more new buildings will be allowed after 2049 either. Pretty much anything that falls into the category of economic activity will need to go, which also means that all people – except for the globalists, of course – will also need to disappear in order to stop them from emitting their very existence and polluting the envisioned globalist utopia.\n\n\"The underlying point is that any asset which uses carbon will have essentially zero value in 2050,\" the report states. \"This in turn may encourage greater use in the run up to 2050 – for example, putting up new buildings at a much faster rate for the next 30 years, knowing that construction must then halt.\"\n\nThe report, by the way, was released in 2019 just prior to covid. In many ways, it serves as a blueprint for what is still to come, which is being catalyzed by the global upheaval that was foisted upon the world in the name of fighting the \"pandemic.\"\n\n\"It is possible that the events of the past two and half years are part of a larger, more sinister agenda that is only just beginning,\" is how The Expose puts it.\n\nMore related news about how stopping climate change and global warming is code for mass depopulation and genocide can be found at Climate.news.\n\nSources for this article include:",

Such fundamental legal foundations of world economic relations as free competition and the immunity of property have been destroyed,” the Russian diplomat noted.\n\nLavrov went on to assert that the American currency has long been used as a weapon, adding that “destructive actions” by Western nations have resulted in producing the opposite effect to the intended one. The diplomat argued that US-led sanctions aimed at isolating Russia and crippling its economy in reality have stimulated the “strengthening of multipolarity in international affairs.”\n\nAccording to Lavrov, there is a growing awareness in the world that “no one is immune” in the face of the “aggressive actions of Washington and Brussels.”\n\nHe noted that not only Russia but many other countries are now “consistently” reducing their dependence on Western currencies by switching to alternatives for foreign-trade settlements.\n\nThe global trend towards using national currencies in trade instead of the US dollar began to gain momentum last year after Ukraine-related sanctions saw Russia cut off from the Western financial system and also saw its foreign reserves frozen.\n\nAs multipolarity takes shape, more nations are working on creating new transport corridors and supply chains. Meanwhile, an “unfair” and “unbalanced” model of globalization has become outdated, Lavrov said.",

They only care about their approval ratings,” he added\n\nJohnson has since promised to advance the long-stalled Ukraine aid bill sought by President Joe Biden this week, multiple news outlets reported on Monday. Johnson reportedly told Republican colleagues at a closed-door meeting that he intends to allow the House to vote on a standalone bill in the coming days that would ensure additional military aid for Kiev. The House will also be expected to vote on separate bills providing more assistance to Israel and Taiwan.\n\nHouse Republicans have previously refused to back the foreign aid bill unveiled by Biden in October, which includes $61 billion in assistance for Ukraine.\n\nThe legislation has been held up for months as the GOP tries to force the White House to crack down on the influx of illegal immigrants via the southern US border. Biden’s 2024 election rival, former President Donald Trump, previously urged Republicans to block the bill, arguing against unconditional aid for Ukraine.\n\nThe delay in approving more weapons for Ukraine has rattled Zelensky and other officials in Kiev, who are blaming mounting battlefield losses on shortages of foreign-supplied ammunition and air defenses.\n\nIn his interview with PBS, Zelensky reiterated that without the US support, Ukraine “will have no chance of winning” in its conflict with Russia.\n\nMoscow, meanwhile, has repeatedly stated that no amount of foreign assistance will change the outcome of the fighting, and has accused the West of escalating the hostilities.",

As things stand today, the United States has not adjusted our nuclear posture, but it is something that we monitor day by day, hour by hour, because it is a paramount priority to the president.”\n\nWhen asked if the Biden administration was “concerned” about the situation, Sullivan said, “Anytime you have a nuclear power fighting in a conflict zone in Europe near NATO territory, of course we have to focus on and be concerned about the possibility of escalation, the risk of escalation.”\n\nHowever, Sullivan again doubled down on his previous comment that officials “have not seen anything that would require us to change our nuclear posture at this time.”\n\nWithin days of invading Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his nuclear forces on high alert, blaming the “hostile actions” and statements of Western nations and NATO.\n\n“Western countries are not only taking unfriendly actions against our country in the economic area. I’m speaking about the illegitimate sanctions that everyone is well aware of. However, the top officials of the leading NATO countries also make aggressive statements against our country as well,” Putin said in a televised meeting with top ministers.\n\nAs a result, Putin said that he has ordered “the minister of defense and the chief of the general staff [of the Russian armed forces] to transfer the deterrence forces of the Russian army to a special mode of combat duty.”\n\nThe deterrence forces include command of Russia’s vast arsenal of nuclear weapons, although it is unclear what a “special mode of combat duty” refers to.\n\nPutin’s order means that Russia’s nuclear weapons are prepared for the increased possibility of launch, raising the possibility that Western nations could be subject to nuclear strikes if they get too involved in the Ukraine conflict.\n\nHowever, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on March 9 called Putin’s threat to use nuclear weapons in the Ukraine–Russia conflict a “bluff.”\n\nOn March 13, Russian and Ukrainian negotiators said that there had been progress in talks between both sides regarding a potential end to the conflict.\n\nThe Kyiv government is continuing to demand an “end of the war and the withdrawal of [Russian] troops,” Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelensky, wrote on Twitter, adding that he believes Ukraine will “achieve some results literally in a matter of days.”\n\nWhile both sides appear to be optimistic about the potential to end the more than two-week-long conflict, no further details were provided.",

It is going to be the most debilitating strike on America, possibly ever.\n\n“And we may not recover from it in a timely fashion. This could be how we lose our first war on Earth is losing the war in space.”\n\nWeichert slammed the \"arrogant\" DC political class, claiming they didn’t foresee any rival challenging Washington’s dominance in the post-Cold-War world.\n\nMost read in The Sun\n\nHe said: “They thought there would never be a need for any kind of preventative or security measure because we thought we would always be dominant, and we thought no one would be crazy enough to challenge us.\n\n“Well here we are 30 years later, and you have Russia, China, North Korea, and even Iran showing us that it was the wrong assumption.”\n\nThe expert feared that the US has a 60 percent chance of being pushed out of space by its rivals completely.\n\nPresident Biden unleashed a package of sanctions against Moscow on Thursday after Putin’s forces rolled into Ukraine.\n\nAnd, an additional 7,000 troops will be sent to Eastern Europe to bolster Nato’s defenses.\n\nRussia’s invasion of the besieged nation saw Europe plunged into its biggest crisis since World War II.\n\nExperts claim the world has not seen a crisis since the Cuban Missile Crisis in the 1960s.\n\nThe flashpoint was the closest point the world came to a full-blown nuclear war.\n\nUS intelligence feared that Kyiv could fall within 96 hours and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said it’s a “possibility” that Putin could move beyond the borders of Ukraine.\n\nThe Russian strongman may feel emboldened and seek to move on to other nations if successful.\n\nTroops have reportedly already been spotted in the Belarussian city of Brest – 10 miles east of the Polish border.\n\nBiden told reporters Thursday: “He has much larger ambitions. He wants to, in fact, re-establish the former Soviet Union. That’s what this is all about.”\n\nWeichert said: “If Putin suspects the West will prop up a formidable anti-Russian resistance in a post-invasion Ukraine, he will risk not only nuclear war but also will threaten to attack US assets in space and the ISS.\n\n“Putin fully understands the concept of asymmetrical warfare.”\n\nHe speculated that Moscow will ramp up its threats in cyberspace and nuclear warfare.\n\nPUTIN'S THREATS\n\nIn December, Weichert warned that Moscow is plotting to launch a Pearl Harbor attack on the US in the cosmos.\n\nThe Pearl Harbor attack of December 1941 left America reeling as Japanese forces bombed the US naval port.\n\nIn his book, Winning Space: How America Remains a Superpower, Weichert says that Russian co-orbital satellites, known as space stalkers, have been tailgating US satellites for years.\n\nHe predicts that the stalkers will eventually hit the satellites, sending them crashing into the ground.\n\nWeichert believes Russia is preparing to launch a \"devastating\" attack on American satellites at the time of its own choice.\n\nHe warned that before launching an attack on Washington’s satellites, Moscow would \"engage in a series of escalations” with neighboring nations.\n\nRussia conducted an anti-satellite weapon test (ASAT) in November where it destroyed one of its own satellites that had been in orbit since 1982.\n\nREAD MORE SUN STORIES\n\nBlinken branded the test \"dangerous and irresponsible\" as it created a field of 1,500 pieces of debris, forcing the ISS crew to take shelter.\n\nState Department spokesperson Ned Price said the test marked an increase in the risk to astronauts and cosmonauts on the ISS.\n\nWe pay for your stories!\n\nDo you have a story for The US Sun team?\n\nEmail us at exclusive@the-sun.com or call 212 416 4552.\n\nLike us on Facebook at www.facebook.com/TheSunUS and follow us from our main Twitter account at @TheSunUS",

Environment Program Executive Director Inger Andersen said she lives in Kenya with solar power and clean electricity from the local utility.\n\n“I'm not living in a cave,\" she added.\n\n\"That's all I can say.”\n\nThe remarks from Al Jaber draw criticism from scientists and are in contrast with the view of Antonio Guterres, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, who said at the climate summit on Friday,\n\n“The science is clear: The 1.5C limit is only possible if we ultimately stop burning all fossil fuels. Not reduce, not abate. Phase out, with a clear timeframe.”\n\nAl Jaber’s presidency of COP28 has stirred controversy in recent months. He is the first CEO designated to be president of any climate summit so far. But he is also the chief executive of the national oil company of OPEC's third-largest producer, the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\n\n“The recent comments from COP28 President show how entrenched he is in fossil fuel fantasy and is clearly determined that this COP doesn’t do anything to harm the interests of the oil and gas industry,\" said Mohamed Adow, the director of Power Shift Africa.\n\n“These remarks are a wake-up call to the world and negotiators at COP28 that they are not going to get any help from the COP presidency in delivering a strong outcome on a fossil fuel phase-out and will need to work hard to ensure a few petro-state leaders don’t imperil the planet in their efforts to protect their oil profits.\"\n\nLast week, Al Jaber denied reports of plans to use the climate summit in Dubai to push oil deals.\n\nEarlier last week, the BBC and many other news outlets reported that the UAE planned to use its role as the host of climate talks to forge new oil and gas deals. The BBC cited leaked briefing documents obtained by independent journalists at the Centre for Climate Reporting working alongside the BBC. Those documents were purportedly prepared by the UAE’s COP28 team for meetings with at least 27 foreign governments during the climate summit which Dubai will host from November 30 to December 12.",

Ralph Northam, the state enacted a law in 2021 that hitched it to California’s stringent vehicle emissions standards, the latest version of which will require the phase-out of internal combustion engine models by 2035. Current Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin and his administration announced Wednesday that Virginia will not be following California’s new regulations once the current set expires at the end of the year.\n\n“Once again, Virginia is declaring independence – this time from a misguided electric vehicle mandate imposed by unelected leaders nearly 3,000 miles away from the Commonwealth,” Youngkin said in a statement. “The idea that government should tell people what kind of car they can or can’t purchase is fundamentally wrong. Virginians deserve the freedom to choose which vehicles best fit the needs of their families and businesses. The law is clear, and I am proud to announce Virginians will no longer be forced to live under this out-of-touch policy.” (RELATED: Glenn Youngkin And Virginia Universities Are In Bitter Battle Over Future Of Diversity, Equity And Inclusion On Campuses)\n\nOnce again, Virginia is declaring independence – this time from a misguided electric vehicle mandate imposed by unelected leaders nearly 3,000 miles away from the Commonwealth.\n\n— Governor Glenn Youngkin (@GovernorVA) June 5, 2024\n\nYoungkin has opposed the policy because “California’s requirements for their citizens should not be a one size fits all solution for Virginia,” the governor’s staff previously told to the Daily Caller News Foundation. Previous efforts by state Republicans to repeal the law linking Virginia to California’s standards failed, and legislative avenues to get rid of the rules closed when Democrats cemented control of the state legislature in last fall’s elections.\n\nThe governor’s office cited a legal opinion by Republican Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares to substantiate its decision. Miyares’ opinion asserted that the state is not obligated to abide by the California Air Resource Board’s (CARB) Advanced Clean Cars II rules, which would have taken effect at the beginning of 2025 and required EVs to make up 35% of all new car sales starting in model year 2026 on the way to 100% by 2035.\n\n“Given that EVs only amounted to 9% of vehicles sold in Virginia in 2023, application of the misguided mandates could have resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties,” Youngkin’s office said in the official announcement. “Virginia auto consumers and dealers could be forced to bear these costs. Not only would this leave auto dealers with less money to pay staff, offer raises, and grow their businesses, it could force many small auto dealers to permanently close their doors.”\n\nNumerous Democrat-leaning or blue states have adopted CARB’s auto emissions standards, which are more stringent than federal standards, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nNeither CARB nor the office of Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom responded immediately to requests for comment.",

This speculation is nothing new, but what’s different this time around is that the attempted assassination of Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico will be on every voter’s mind, thus likely influencing the outcome.\n\nThe preceding hyperlinked analysis argued that fake news was responsible for radicalizing the pro-Ukrainian suspect into thinking that shooting his premier was a legitimate form of protest against what he’d been misled by the media into believing was his “pro-Russian dictator with blood on his hands”. This black swan event might have served the short-term interests of that leader’s many enemies, but the blowback could be considerable if it leads to a conservative landslide during next month’s elections.\n\nHungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban predicted that the upcoming vote will influence the direction of war and peace in Europe, and while the European Parliament admittedly can’t do much in terms of shaping the NATO-Russian proxy war in Ukraine, it could still exert positive pressure if conservatives win. It’s with that in mind that Eurocrats like von der Leyen and Jourova are fearmongering about Russian meddling since they want to preemptively discredit this potential outcome.\n\nTo be sure, the first of those two had no idea that an assassination attempt would be made against Fico the day after she shared her earlier mentioned warning, but the second’s assessment about the upcoming elections being a test of the bloc’s disinformation resilience came some days later. Instead of speaking vaguely about alleged Russian meddling, the Eurocrats are now honing their information warfare narrative to muddle the conversation about Fico’s attempted assassination and its political aftermath.\n\nThe targeted audience is the unclear number of on-the-fence voters who might usually lean liberal but have recently begun to sympathize with some conservative positions on issues like Ukraine. Last week’s incident was driven by the liberal media’s fake news about the Slovak leader, which might influence some of these voters to give the more narratively responsible conservatives their support. In an attempt to desperately prevent this, the Eurocrats want them think that it would be doing Russia’s bidding.\n\nIf the European Parliamentary elections have absolutely no effect on anything, then they wouldn’t care who votes for whom, but the outcome will clearly at the very least have a major impact on popular perceptions and could lead to cascading consequences like more anti-war protests across the bloc. It’s for this reason that the Eurocrats and their media allies, including those being promoted by state-run Ukrainian outlets like this one here, are pushing the abovementioned information warfare narrative.\n\nThe growing gap between liberals and conservatives over Ukraine, which is foreign policy issue that Fico was most closely associated with, is naturally occurring as a result of their polar opposite worldviews and not due to Russian meddling. It’s so emotive and significant that some from both sides have become single-issue voters who’ll cast their ballots purely based on candidates’ positions towards this. Attempting to discredit this trend as being due to Russian meddling is disrespectful to democracy.",

In Costa Rica, the impact is apparent due to high temperatures, changes in rainfall patterns, and now the decline in sea turtle hatchlings.\n\nExperts from the APM Terminals Turtle Conservation Program, which protects sea turtle eggs and releases hatchlings on the beach that spans from the mouth of the Moín river to the mouth of the Matina River, have determined that this year the number of hatchlings and turtle releases in Moín will reach 10,000. In contrast, in 2022, approximately 30,000 turtles were released.\n\nClimate change and its repercussions, such as rising sea levels, high sea temperatures, and shifts in migration and feeding patterns, are resulting in fewer hatchlings.\n\n“There’s a decrease in turtle births on all nesting beaches from the Guajira Peninsula in Colombia to southern Nicaragua. We are monitoring data related to conditions exacerbated by and associated with climate change, such as warm waters in the North Atlantic that produce less food, and hot beaches with temperatures exceeding 34° Celsius, leading to infertile nests,” said Didiher Chacón, a specialist in Marine Sciences and the director of the Latin American Sea Turtles Association.\n\nRisk factors\n\nClimate change presents challenges that threaten the development of fertile turtle eggs and the births of leatherback, green, and hawksbill turtles.\n\nFor instance, sea turtles exhibit temperature-dependent sex determination. During incubation, the temperature determines whether the offspring will be male or female. Rising temperatures are producing more female turtles, thereby reducing the chances of reproduction.\n\nFurthermore, the rise in sea levels, due to glacier melting and the thermal expansion of the oceans, results in a loss of nesting and feeding habitats for sea turtles. Nesting beaches may erode or become submerged, limiting the available space for turtles to nest.\n\nMarine species rely on ocean currents and water temperatures for their migrations. Climate change can disrupt these patterns, affecting the availability of food and altering the migration routes of sea turtles.\n\nMoreover, climate change can influence the availability and distribution of the turtles’ prey. Fluctuations in water temperatures and ocean acidification can destabilize marine ecosystems, thereby impacting the quantity and quality of food sources for sea turtles.\n\nDidiher Chacón emphasized that people can help the cause through actions such as abstaining from consuming turtle eggs, participating in volunteer programs aimed at nest protection, cleaning beaches, minimizing their greenhouse gas emissions, recycling to curtail the demand for plastics, and educating the younger generations about these measures.",

(”NY’s school bus dilemma: Some voters tap brakes on switch to electric vehicles,” July 29, 2024).\n\nWe 20 million New Yorkers should continue to oppose these types of programs and the rules and regulations (i.e., a gas stove ban!) that will cost each of us money but have negligible effect on climate change. Many of the 8 billion inhabitants of this planet will continue to use organic sources to cook, heat, drive and survive. They have little access to an electric infrastructure that will allow them to do otherwise.\n\nOur own infrastructure may not support the change that some envision without costly upgrades. We definitely need to be a little cautious before paying for first-class accommodations on the climate change train, as noted in an Aug. 1 Wall Street Journal commentary by Bjorn Lomborg, “Polar Bears, Dead Coral and other Climate Fictions.” It notes that many of the dire predictions promoted by the climate lobby are simply not true.\n\nRenewable energy resources are a good thing and, with time and with good policies, we will get there.

Farming uses nitrogen, and suddenly, nitrogen is the new antagonist in the tale of global warming. The narrative is simple: eliminate nitrogen, and save the world. Yet, in the name of “preservation,” entire segments of our food production are under siege.\n\nConsider rice – a staple for half the world’s population. Renowned agencies claim, “Rice accounts for roughly 10% of global methane emissions,” emphasising the urgent need to curtail its production. But the ramifications? Starvation for billions.\n\nLook to the Netherlands for further evidence. Dutch farmers, the backbone of a nation that is a leading exporter of meat and agricultural products, are being chased off their lands. A staggering number, 3,000 farms, are forecasted to be confiscated in the coming years. The tragic fallout is evident, with a reported 20 to 30 farmers tragically ending their lives annually.\n\nOur friends in Europe are no strangers to these baffling decisions either. The European Commission greenlit a strategy to compensate livestock farmers for halting their operations in certain areas – with a stipulation that they never resume their animal breeding activities. The implications are clear: a drop in global food availability and an inevitable spike in prices.\n\nRemember Sri Lanka’s ill-fated venture into 100% organic farming? The island nation faced a humanitarian nightmare with a staggering 90% of its population on the brink of starvation.\n\nRead more: Globalists’ war on the world’s food supply",

Tucker Carlson interviewed Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin last week.\n\nEveryone, even the Davos/UK dominated media, has put forth their opinion on it. I gave out a quick take for my Patrons the morning after just like everyone else. And like everyone else I missed the biggest takeaway from this interview.\n\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\n\nNow, if you go through the commentary what you will mostly see is people, as always, doing what traders call “talking their book.” In other words, as opposed to dealing with the information presented and the motivations of the people involved, most media outlets and commentators put forth their opinion on whether this interview satisfied their needs from it.\n\nSo, for the hardcore geopolitical types and armchair psychoanalysts, we heard a lot of opinions second-guessing Putin’s strategy to open the interview with a nearly thirty minute recitation of Russian/Ukrainian history. Why would he do this, was the common refrain.\n\nI’ll use my former-bellwether-for-normies, Scott Adams, as an example of this.\n\nHow many of you thought Putin was “all there” in the Tucker interview?\n\nIf he seemed lucid to you, it’s because Biden is your comparison.\n\nI thought Putin seemed unhinged. The history lesson was not a good sign. https://t.co/VZiEIHRZ2t\n\n— Scott Adams (@ScottAdamsSays) February 9, 2024\n\nThis was the kindest of the ‘bad takes’ I found on this. But I’m having one of Scott’s “One movie, two screens,” moments here. Because Putin looked anything other than “unhinged.” In fact, he looked as calm as I’ve ever seen him, taking a relaxed posture to put Carlson, who was clearly unsure of where he stood at the beginning of the interview, at ease.\n\nBut this is the message that Adams wanted to see, framing Putin in relation to Biden, because he needed something unique to say to justify his even being in the conversation.\n\nBy contrast, Martin Armstrong had a great post curating all of the crazy Neocon takes from the “media” on his blog over the weekend.\n\nWhat’s obvious from those is that they understood that Putin’s 30 minute opening monologue would put off a lot of casual watchers who would tune him out at that point. So, their “analysis” focused on steering the conversation to Putin’s ‘false history’ of Russia and Ukraine.\n\nThis way that ‘false history’ would dominate everyone’s opinions the next day, managing the Overton Window of the entire interview, making it all about that. This would be the basis of how they discredit Putin.\n\nThen to discredit Carlson, people like Hillary Clinton was trotted out to lie about Tucker Carlson, calling him a “useful idiot,” and “puppy dog” and a joke in Russian media, which is an outright lie. Hillary’s harpy laugh made an appearance alongside a sycophant interviewer as they joked about Carlson’s having been fired from every legitimate news agency.\n\nWe were treated to a common sight: Two Beltway insiders laughing inside their echo chamber and only our sick fascination with roadkill makes it even remotely interesting.\n\nSo, the whole exercise is reframed as Puppy Dog Tucker throwing softballs to Liar Putin to distract us away from the sum and substance of their talk.\n\nI know… in other news water is wet and women want more sex when they’re fertile.",

Now, let’s talk about the benefits. We know it sounds like a paradox. This is, after all, a war so who can possibly benefit? The defence industry.\n\nWars can lead to an increase in defence spending. The more prolonged and intense the conflict, the greater the demand. A government that is fighting a war will obviously spend more money. So, nations invest heavily in technology, in weaponry, and in infrastructure.\n\nThis heightened demand helps defence companies across the globe, and that causes stocks to rally. Take U.S. defence stocks for example. They have added $23 billion in market value since the war began. On Monday, Northrop Grumman soared by 12%, General Dynamics jumped 9%, Lockheed Martin gained 8% and RTX rallied 4%, and this is only expected to grow in the days ahead.\n\nTake Lockheed Martin, for example. This company makes the F-35 fighter jets being used by the Israel military. They also make Black Hawk helicopters. Northrop Grumman makes combat vehicles. Israel uses all these weapons and will need more in the future. The U.S. will be sending more weapons to Israel in the coming days, so the stocks of these companies are expected to rally.\n\nAnd this won’t be the first time this happens. Last year too, defence stocks got a huge boost when Russia invaded Ukraine. As of today, the US has spent over $40 billion in military aid to Ukraine, so the biggest beneficiary is the American defence sector and that is likely to be the case with this war too.\n\nThis is one of the harshest realities of war. For some people, wars cost lives and for others, they drive value. For defence companies wars act as economic stimulus, they bolster sales, they fuel job creation and sometimes they also boost local economies.\n\nNow, of course, this does raise moral and ethical questions like: is this profiting from human suffering? More importantly: is this motivation to prolong a conflict? Plus, there is the investor dilemma: defence stocks are often called sin stocks, or warmonger investments.\n\nBut the label here doesn’t matter, these stocks surge massively during war and that makes them very attractive for investors. Currently, the world is dealing with two wars - the Ukraine war, and now, the Israel-Hamas war. Defence spending was already on the rise this year. Europe has ramped up military sending, the highest since the cold war. Asian nations have also bumped spending. Defence budgets of Japan and South Korea grew by 7% in 2022, India’s defence budget was $81.4 billion in 2022, a rise of 6% from 2021.\n\nCurrently, global military spending is at $2.24 trillion, which is 2.2% of the world’s GDP. Chances are it will only rise further in the coming days.",

        "text": "Ocean acidification claims of climate cult are based on misinformation \n\n The truth that IPCC and NOAA do not want people to know includes the fact that CO2 breaks down into three different molecules when combined with water. These molecules are collectively known as dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and one of them includes bicarbonate ions that comprise more than 90 percent of the ocean's current.\n\nCarbonate ions comprise about nine percent of DIC, leaving invading CO2 levels at no more than one percent, which is inconsequential. This means that IPCC and NOAA are lying about CO2 acidifying the world's oceans when ocean waters actually contain less than one percent CO2.\n\nIt must also be noted that the other 99-plus percent of bicarbonate and carbonate ions that CO2 turns into when mixing with ocean water actually creates a buffer that prevents ocean water from acidifying. This creates what is essentially distilled water throughout ocean currents.\n\n(Related: In 2021, a handful of scientist whistleblowers exposed ocean acidification as just another climate hoax designed to fool the masses into supporting more green tyranny.)\n\nOne of the other myths being spread by IPCC and NOAA involves the false claim that acidified ocean water, supposedly caused by too much CO2, is causing the shells of ocean creatures to dissolve. This simply cannot be true for the simple fact that ocean creatures with shells have protective coatings that prevent dissolution.\n\nThe same is true for coral polyps, which have special protection that guards their reef skeletons against being eroded through acidification. And ocean water is actually more protective than distilled water at keeping these shells intact to begin with, which makes climate claims to the contrary simply ridiculous.\n\n\"Shells and reefs are made of calcium carbonate,\" writes Jim Steele. \"The hoax abuses one true scientific factoid: At a lower pH, the added H+ ions will re-join with the ocean's buffering carbonate ions.\"\n\n\"That reduces sea water's available carbonate ions by converting them to bicarbonate ion. So, alarmists' falsely claim acidification will reduce seawater's carbonate ions, making it more difficult to make calcium carbonate shells or reefs.\"\n\nPart of the climate hoax suggests that ocean shells and reefs import carbonate ions directly from seawater, but that too much CO2 inhibits this. All available evidence shows that shells and reefs only import CO2 and abundant bicarbonate ions, which are then converted internally to a carbonate ion.\n\nIn other words, CO2 from the atmosphere mixes with ocean water and turns into the exact ingredients that shells and reefs need to build strength and resiliency. CO2 actually helps them, not hurts them like the climate cult falsely claims.\n\nThe newly converted carbonate ions that result internally from CO2 mixing into water combines with calcium to form the calcium carbonate building blocks needed for reef skeletons and shells.\n\n\"Thus, any acidification that converts sea water carbonate ions into bicarbonate ions is actually helping reefs and shell-making which only absorb the critical CO2 and bicarbonate ions,\" Steele further explains.\n\n\"Knowing the real science, I can no longer trust the IPCC or NOAA's acidification alarmism misinformation.\"\n\nFurther debunking the ocean acidification myth is the fact that the CO extracted from water, both salt and fresh, by coral, mollusks and other sea life ends up becoming chalk, limestone and marble.\n\n\"Amazingly, despite what we are told, the oceans are not boiling and one can still pick up seashells at the seashore,\" one commenter wrote, adding to this sentiment.",

I've donated money to Labour for many years, to help them compete and hopefully win the election. I believe they will make Britain a better country.\n\nA Labour source said: 'The onshore wind ban put up energy bills for families and made Britain more energy insecure.\n\n'By lifting the ban, this Labour Government is cutting bills for families and boosting Britain's energy independence.'",

Nixon favorably compared the standard of living of American suburbanites to that of their Russian counterparts under Communism.\n\nCriticizing Soviet society was a serious crime in those days, but I doubt that the Russians ever considered arresting Nixon and giving him a ten year stretch in the gulag for “anti-Soviet agitation.” Not even Maoist China at the height of its Cultural Revolution would have considered such a thing.\n\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\n\nBut late last week, on the eve of a Russia-China leadership summit in Moscow, Europe’s International Criminal Court (ICC) in the Hague issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin, the man who controls the world’s largest nuclear arsenal, whose striking power is further enhanced by its revolutionary hypersonic delivery systems.\n\nThe charges against Putin were that he had ordered the humanitarian evacuation of children from the dangerous Ukraine warzone, and the ICC also ordered the arrest of Maria Lvova-Belova, the Russian Commissioner for Children’s Rights.\n\nYet oddly enough, no ICC action had ever been taken against American Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who had famously declared in 1996 that the deaths of 500,000 Iraqi children brought about by the American economic sanctions she supported was “worth it.”\n\nIndeed, in 2016 National Security Advisor John Bolton leveled harsh threats against ICC judges if they dared take legal action against any Americans accused of torture and murder, and many have noticed the strange lack of ICC even-handedness over the years.\n\nThe International Criminal Court that we don’t recognize has issued an arrest warrant against Putin for evacuating children from a Warzone that is getting shelled with our weapons and we are the ones who killed over 20 million people in 37 victim nations since WW2. pic.twitter.com/e8ffVvChbN\n\n— Kim Dotcom (@KimDotcom) March 18, 2023\n\nBut issuing a press release or even an arrest warrant does not necessarily determine events in real life, and the Moscow summit between Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping has hardly been disturbed. Taken together, Russia and China control a substantial fraction of the world’s natural resources and industrial capacity, and although their global propaganda presence is weak, those former factors are more important as elements of real world power.\n\nAs an example of this, last week Saudi Arabia and Iran, two of the most important Middle Eastern countries, announced in Beijing that after negotiations held under Chinese auspices they had reestablished diplomatic relations despite many years of bitter hostility:\n\n- Russia, China, Iran…and Saudi Arabia?\n\nRon Unz • The Unz Review • March 13, 2023 • 3,200 Words\n\nOver the last few months, America and its Western allies have declared their unilateral right to set a cap on the price Russia charges for its oil, seeking to use their dominance over the international financial infrastructure to reduce Russian revenue on its sale of natural resources to other countries.\n\nRussia and Saudi Arabia are two of the world’s leading oil exporters, and with the latter nation now having dramatically shifted towards the Russia-China alliance, its leadership recently declared that they would ban sales to any country that sought to impose a price cap on its oil.",

This would be an act of aggression that Russian President Vladimir Putin described as guaranteed to draw a harsh military response from Russia, possibly even including a nuclear strike against Berlin.\n\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\n\nAnd that has led to an admission by German officials that their military is woefully unprepared to take on Russia. If German generals and politicians truly want to provoke a war with Russia, they had better slow down and wait for their military to catch up to the political rhetoric coming out of Berlin.\n\nA March 14 article by John Cody at Remix News shows that the German Army lacks the personnel, equipment and infrastructure to wage a major war of any kind, let alone with a nuclear-armed military superpower like Russia.\n\n“Germany’s own military and government are painting such a dire picture of the armed forces that there are now calls from some of the most powerful politicians in the country to reinstate mandatory military service,” Cody writes.\n\nYes, a military draft.\n\nA video produced by Remix News details testimony provided by Eva Högl, German Parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces, who provided catastrophic details about the state of the German military.

It’s strange that it still exists but it may have found a new purpose – instigating World War III with Russia.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, “the Weimar Triangle exists mostly in the form of summit meetings between the leaders of the three countries and of their foreign ministers. The collaboration between member states includes inter-parliamentary contacts, military, scientific and cultural co-operation. The most recent summit of leaders occurred in Paris on June 12, 2023.” (Emphasis mine)",

BioMADE announced on its website on June 3 that it is looking for new ideas to reduce the CO2 emissions from food production and transport at military sites. These ideas include \"novel cell culture methods suitable for the production of cultivated meat or protein\" – essentially a euphemism for lab-grown fake meat.\n\nLab-grown meat is a new technology where animal muscle and fat tissues are grown from modified animal cells in special equipment. This process uses a mix of chemicals, pressure and temperature to create meat that resembles beef, chicken and pork. Though still in the experimental stage, lab-grown meat has sparked a debate about its efficiency and ethics of producing meat without killing animals. (Related: Lab-made chicken meat grown from CANCER CELLS receives FDA approval - Are you ready to eat TUMOR nuggets?)\n\nBut according to a 2023 study by researchers at the University of California-Davis, the carbon footprint of lab-grown beef might be worse than that of the product it seeks to replace. It zoomed in on the use of highly refined or purified growth media, which is used to help animal cells multiply. They wrote that lab-grown meat using purified media in its production has a global warming potential four to 25 times greater than the average compared to the real thing.\n\nHuman knowledge is under attack!

Although the U.S. Department of Agriculture approved two California companies to sell cultured chicken to restaurants in 2023, some believe taxpayer money shouldn’t fund the lab-grown meat industry.\n\nJack Hubbard, executive director for the Center for the Environment and Welfare (CEW), was among the vocal critics of the plan. \"Taxpayer dollars should not be used to fund the lab-grown meat sector,\" he remarked.\n\n\"Our troops deserve better than to be served lab-grown meat, produced in bioreactors with immortalized cells and chemicals.

However, their policies are not simply the product of deranged individuals but of the profound crisis of world capitalism for which they have no rational, progressive solution and see a global war for domination as the only way out.\n\nWar is being accompanied by savage repression against any opposition as the terrible, continued persecution of Julian Assange for exposing the crimes of US imperialism graphically demonstrates.\n\nOur comrade Bogdan Syrotiuk of the Young Guard of Bolshevik Leninists has been detained by the fascistic Zelensky government in Ukraine earlier this month on false accusations of being a Russian agent. Bogdan has courageously opposed the war in Ukraine, along with his comrades in Russia, denounced both the Ukrainian and Russian regimes and fought for the unity of the Ukrainian and Russian working class.\n\nIn the US and other imperialist countries, brutal police crackdowns are taking place against protesters opposing the Gaza genocide with thousands of arrests including of students.\n\nThe ongoing anti-war protests in universities and cities are significant, but on their own are incapable of halting the bloodbath. For seven months, the Zionist regime and its imperialist backers have not only ignored protests by millions around the world, but they are also turning to police repression.\n\nThe only social force capable of halting the drive to world war is the international working class which is coming into struggle in Sri Lanka and around the world in opposition to the austerity program of the ruling classes. As governments engage in, support and prepare for war, it is workers who are forced to bear the burden.\n\nA struggle against war requires the building of a unified anti-war movement of the working class based on a socialist program, exposing the futility of protest politics and all the apologists for imperialism. Appeals to capitalist governments are bankrupt. The independent mobilisation of workers on this basis needs to take up the fight to free Assange and Syrotiuk as well.\n\nThe burning need is for a new revolutionary leadership in the working class based on socialist internationalism to abolish the source of militarism, austerity, authoritarianism and all sorts of social misery—the capitalist system.\n\nWe invite you to participate in this important meeting.

However, he is not the only one who was humiliated and stunned by the success of the Ukrainian Armed Forces on Russian territory. Ukraine's partners, among those who provide weapons but restrict their use, are in the same position.\n\nThis is the opinion of Colonel Richard Justin Kemp, a retired British Army officer and knight, who was awarded the highest honor in the UK. In his opinion, the Ukrainian offensive \"showed the cowardice of the allies,\" especially US President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.\n\nSir Richard Kemp recalls how President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had previously asked Western partners to allow the use of long-range weapons to protect both Ukrainian soldiers and Ukraine in general.\n\n\"The British Storm Shadow missiles could make a difference in this battle, but the British government is unwilling to allow them to be used to their full potential. What, in Sir Keir Starmer's opinion, is the point of a strike on Russian territory, apart from protecting Ukraine? And how would the Second World War have ended if the Prime Minister had not allowed British and American bombs to fall on German soil?\" asks the colonel.\n\nAccording to Sir Richard Kemp, throughout the entire period of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, \"the most pathetic were the Western allies\" who pursued a policy not based on Ukraine's defense needs, \"but on the groundless fear of Russian retaliation.\" And although all of Putin's so-called red lines turned out to be nothing more than baseless intimidation, each subsequent Western decision to provide Ukraine with long-range missiles, tanks, or combat aircraft \"was reluctant, half-hearted, inadequate, and gripped by fear.\"\n\nIncidentally, it was these fears and the \"miserable policy\" of the partners that ensured the success of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Kursk region, the Briton believes.\n\n\"Ukraine was able to launch an unexpected attack on Russian territory because most of the border with the enemy was left almost unguarded. The fact is that Putin knew that his territory remained virtually invulnerable to attack because of Western restrictions on the use of weapons. This also applies to airfields, supply routes, and logistics bases. Significant forces needed to protect them have been thrown into the war in Ukraine,\" the colonel said.\n\n\"What Western leaders don't realize is that when you're facing a tyrant like Putin, escalation is the only language he fears and understands. We see the same thing in the Middle East, where Biden is pleading with Israel to de-escalate. But his unconvincing 'no' will not stop Ayatollah Khamenei from pushing the button and launching Iran's expected missile attack, just as it did not stop Putin from attacking Ukraine,\" Sir Richard Kemp said.\n\nUkraine's offensive near Kursk has taught the West a \"salutary lesson,\" the military said.\n\n\"Despite the capture of thousands of square kilometers of Russia's holy shrines, no nuclear missiles were raining down on Kyiv. The truth is that if Ukraine had been allowed to escalate from the very beginning, it could have brought this war to an end on favorable terms for Kyiv,\" the British colonel believes.\n\nOnly verified information is available on the OBOZ.UA Telegram channel and Viber.

Not long after that, the agency hopes to axe all gas cars from the market entirely.\n\nThe program would be phased in starting in 2027, when all light-duty vehicles sold new will need to meet new greenhouse gas performance standards. By 2032, between 64 and 67 percent of all new car sales would need to be EVs only.\n\n\"This is the planned rationing of vehicles,\" says Marc Morano of The Climate Depot. \"The planned rationing of American cars. That's the only way this plan makes sense ... the only result is going to be shortages of cars and a completely altered used car market.\"\n\n(Related: In case you missed it, the Biden regime also proposed a nationwide ban on gas stoves last fall, but then relented due to widespread unpopularity.)\n\nAs explained by Morano, all of this is exactly what happened to places like Cuba and East Germany, which succumbed to communism under similar circumstances.\n\n\"You can look to Cuba to find out what it's like to have a raging used car market because that's what we're looking at here,\" he warns.\n\n\"And you can look to old East Germany. East Germany had their famed Trabant car, where people would have to get on waiting lists for years to get one, and that's what we're faced with here when the government is going to mandate that you can only buy a new electric car.\"\n\nThe left-wing obsession with all things electric is nonsensical from the perspective of affordability and reliability. Earth-based fuels like oil and gas are abundant, inexpensive, and highly reliable, while electric power is expensive, unreliable, and just plain stupid.\n\nHow will the average person power his EV in the event of a power outage? What about when he becomes stranded out in the middle of nowhere with no charging stations anywhere in sight?\n\nIn the United States, at least, there is still time to stop this madness. Our country does not have to go the way of Australia, where some banks are now refusing to finance loans for people wanting to purchase gas-powered vehicles.\n\nThe World Bank is also moving in the same direction, having promised to phase out all funding for gas-powered cars in the shockingly near term.\n\n\"The powers that be, the corporate world, the bankers, the governments, academia – they've decided that gas-powered cars are over and they're putting all the forces into play to end it without our say in it,\" Morano warns.\n\nThen we have the Biden regime, which wants the imposition of new pollution limits that would force at least 54 percent of all new vehicles to be sold as electric models by the year 2030.\n\n\"I believe it's pretty doable,\" said Margo Oge, chair of the International Council on Clean Transportation and a former Obama regime EPA official. \"The industry is there. Europe is ahead of the U.S., China is ahead of Europe, and these companies are global companies.\"\n\nEverything big government is trying to do aims to stamp out freedom and liberty – but in the name of \"saving the planet.\" To learn more, visit GreenTyranny.news.\n\nSources for this article include:",

These “representatives” at Dubai’s COP28 summit decided to unite in putting an end to fossil fuels … literally the same thing they’ve said they wanted to do since the Kyoto Protocol of December 1997.\n\nThe Kyoto Protocol was one of the first annual “summits” held by unelected Bond villains who want to decide our fate. At the time, the countries present decided to cut fossil fuel use around the world, lest we be dead or drowning within a decade or two, which turned out to be a lie.\n\nAlmost 30 years later, these idiots still think they deserve a big annual party to celebrate the hoax that they’re doing a damn thing to help our species work in symbiosis with the natural environment.\n\nMega Rich Elite Release Video Suggesting Normal People Should Consider Eating Rotten Food https://t.co/W6xGaIID2I\n\n— Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) August 7, 2022\n\nCOP28 President Sultan al-Jaber had the audacity to call their latest deal “historic.” This deal is only historic because it’s been repeated for the last 26 years, and yet nothing has ever come of it. Why? Because even if what the left said about climate change was true, there would be nothing we could do to stop the runaway process of an ever-evolving global ecosystem. (RELATED: Microchipping Your Child? ‘There Are Solid Rational Reasons For It,’ Say Supreme Overlords Of The WEF)\n\nBut the funniest comment of the week came from Norway’s minister of Foreign Affairs, Espen Barth Eide, who said: “It is the first time that the world unites around such a clear text on the need to transition away from fossil fuels.” It is literally the 26th time such an agreement has been made. And guess what happened after all the other agreements?\n\nAbsolutely nothing, other than our freedoms being removed without our consent.

In response, Russia cut off electricity supplies to Finland on Friday.\n\nPutin told Niinisto that Finland’s abandonment “of its traditional policy of military neutrality would be an error since there are no threats to Finland’s security,” the Kremlin said in a statement issued after the call. “Such a change in the country’s foreign policy could negatively affect Russian-Finnish relations, which had been built in the spirit of good neighborliness and partnership for many years, and were mutually beneficial.”\n\nNiinisto’s office said in a statement that he told Putin how starkly Finland’s security environment had changed after Moscow’s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe exchange came amid escalating rhetoric over the potential for NATO to expand beyond its current 30 members.\n\n“If Finland wants to join this bloc, then our goal is absolutely legitimate — to question the existence of this state. This is logical,” said Aleksey Zhuravlyov, 59, the deputy chairman of the Russian parliament’s defense committee, said in an interview with The Mirror. “The Finns in general should be grateful to Russia for their statehood, for the fact that Finland exists as a country.”\n\n“If the United States threatens our state, it’s good: here is the Sarmat [Satan-2] for you, and there will be nuclear ashes from you if you think that Russia should not exist,” he continued. “And Finland says that it is at one with the USA. Well, get in line.”\n\nThe Satan-2 is a ballistic missile capable of carrying 10 to 15 nuclear warheads, with an estimated destructive power of three megatons each.\n\nRussia wouldn’t need to move nukes to its European border to carry out its threat, officials boasted.\n\n“We can hit with a Sarmat [known in the West as Satan-2] from Siberia, and even reach the UK,” he said. “And if we strike from Kaliningrad … the hypersonic’s reaching time is 200 seconds – so go ahead, guys.\n\n“On the Finnish border we will have not strategic weapons, but Kinzhal-class, one that will reach Finland in 20 seconds, or even 10 seconds.”\n\nSeparately, Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko said Russia knows that NATO wants to “militarize everything within reach,” Interfax news agency reported.",

Putin suggested Washington is essentially going to make him a scapegoat.\n\n\"In the West, they simply do not want to replace him [Zelenskyy], the time is not right. I think it's obvious to anyone. They will blame all unpopular decisions on him, including lowering the [military] draft age, and that's it,\" Putin asserted, according to Russian media translation.\n\nThat's when he followed with: \"And then they'll replace him. I think it will happen sometime in the first half of next year.\"\n\nPutin could be at least in part seizing on the obvious increased negative coverage of the Zelensky government in major Western media outlets, from the BBC to NY Times to Wall Street Journal. Indeed Zelensky's 'celebrity power' on display throughout the first part of the war, where it seemed he could simply do no wrong in the media's eyes, is waning fast.\n\nMore importantly, there are signs of large-scale dissent among the Ukrainian population as recruitment officers violently grab men from off the streets.\n\nDespite Kiev forces clearly being against the ropes of late, Zelensky has still refused to even contemplate negotiating. He has stood by his earlier commitment to not enter dialogue toward ceasefire until Putin is out of power. Putin commented on this while in Vietnam:\n\nTalks on Ukraine could take place as early as tomorrow, but Russia will use the current situation as a starting point, the president added.\n\n\"We have been conducting these behind-the-scenes talks, and what we hoped for has failed,\" Putin told reporters.\n\nZelensky's advisor, Alexey Arestovich, argued in 2019:— Glenn Diesen (@Glenn_Diesen) April 9, 2024\n\n- Attempting to join NATO will pressure Russia to invade\n\n- \"Our price for joining NATO is a big war with Russia\"\n\n- Predicting the war would start between 2020-22, with remarkable detailshttps://t.co/8iEn5wSUd9 pic.twitter.com/9fmw5X1DYl\n\nInterestingly, Putin had back in May declared Zelensky \"illegitimate\" after Ukraine failed to hold previously scheduled elections.

Today, the former German interior minister is sharply criticising his former parties regarding their stance on the Ukraine-Russia conflict, the management of the economy and the direction energy policy has taken.\n\nFormer German Interior Minister Otto Schily cautioned against the dangers of Germany taking an unilateral course in the Ukraine conflict, while at the same time clearly arguing in favour of war. „A bellicosity has developed in Germany, which is risky,” Mr Schily told the German Press Agency.\n\n“The Greens, of all people, are too one-sided. There is too little thought about how we can get out of the conflict,”\n\nsaid the former Social Democrat politician, emphasizing that he unreservedly condemns the war and the bloodshed it brings. He added that instead of deepening the conflict, the German federal government should be seeking to find other prospects for Ukraine besides being sent money and weapons. Constructive ideas and political imagination are needed, he said.\n\nMr Schily also told the press agency how he sees the tense situation that has unfolded:\n\n„Ukraine wants to remain independent. Everyone has to acknowledge that. At the same time it must be clear that one has to live with one’s neighbours, including with Russia. Both sides have interests that must be taken into account. Russia will always remain a factor, also with regard to Europe. We have to find a way to deal with the Russians.”\n\nFormer Chancellor Gerhard Schroder’s interior minister believes that it would not be a good move for Ukraine to join NATO. He pointed out that Ukraine’s multilingualism, including the Russian language, is an indisputable fact. Taking a look at other countries shows that the interests of all sides can be safeguarded if a country remains militarily neutral. Mr Schily also sees Ukraine’s accession to the EU as unrealistic and recommends that Ukraine follow the „Swiss model”.\n\nSwitzerland is an excellent example of „how to develop a free society with mutual respect for the different ethnic backgrounds and with military neutrality. Ukraine could take Switzerland as an example,”\n\nhe said, adding that he doesn’t see “how Ukraine’s accession to the EU could work without the EU overstretching.”\n\nMr Schily expressly warned that the German government should not overburden the country economically. He also criticised the three-party coalition government because even amidst the energy crisis, they fail to realise how unwise it is to phase out nuclear power just because the Greens insist on it.\n\n“Now it’s becoming even clearer that completely giving up on nuclear technology was foolish. The total abandonment of nuclear technology has placed us in a very precarious economic situation. Due to the simultaneous phase-out of nuclear power and coal, Germany has become reliant on natural gas,”\n\nhe pointed out.",

Their protests in recent years often caused serious disruption for motorists.\n\nFrom Sunday, police will have powers to move static protests. Critics have argued the toughened laws are a threat to the right to protest, but U.K. officials say the measures were to stop “disruption from a selfish minority.”\n\n“The public have had enough of their lives being disrupted by selfish protesters. The mayhem we’ve seen on our streets has been a scandal,” Home Secretary Suella Braverman said.\n\nAuthorities say that under the new Public Order Act, protesters found guilty of “tunnelling” – or digging underground tunnels to obstruct the building of new infrastructure works – could face three years in prison. Anyone found guilty of obstructing a major transportation project could be jailed for up to six months.\n\nThe law also makes “locking on,” or protesters attaching themselves to other people, objects or buildings, a criminal offense.\n\nHundreds of climate change protesters were arrested last year in the U.K. for blocking major roads and bridges. Many activists protested by sitting in the middle of the roads or gluing themselves to the roadway to make them harder to move.\n\nThe civil disobedience is a wave of direct action that has also seen activists glue themselves to famous museum paintings or throw soup at artworks to draw media attention to their cause.\n\nPolice have said it’s costly to deal with the protests and that they diverted thousands of officers from other work like dealing with crime.\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.",

The preparations are for a “long-term confrontation”.\n\nA growing number of Western rulers have also warned of a military threat from Russia to countries along the eastern flank of NATO, calling for Europe to get prepared by rearming.\n\nThe chief of the intelligence service said the assessment was based on Russian plans to double the number of forces stationed along its border with NATO members Finland and the Baltic States of Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia. “Russia has chosen a path which is a long-term confrontation … and the Kremlin is probably anticipating a possible conflict with NATO within the next decade or so,” Kaupo Rosin told reporters at the release of Estonia’s national security threats report, according to a report by The New York Post.\n\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\n\nRosin claimed that a military attack by Russia is “highly unlikely” in the short term, partly because Russia has to keep troops in Ukraine, and that would be unlikely if the Russian buildup of forces was matched in Europe. “If we are not prepared, the likelihood (of a military Russian attack) would be much higher than without any preparation,” Rosin added.\n\nEstonia and the other Baltic States have increased their military spending to over 2% of the value of their economies after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, and NATO allies have raised their presence in those countries.\n\nGermany plans to have 4,800 combat-ready troops in the region by 2027, in its first permanent foreign deployment since World War Two, and Rosin said NATO and its allies were moving in the right direction to counter the Russian threat. –The New York Post.\n\nRussia has repeatedly warned that it will go to war with NATO if the West’s weapons defeat Russia, or lethal aid is sent to Ukraine.

He did not predict, however, when the slowdown would start.\n\nGuterres noted that economies outside the United States, Europe, and Asia would face worsening economic conditions. Developing countries in Africa, South America, and much of Asia are seeing rising interest rates, he noted.\n\n“Interest rates are going up extremely in the global south. Countries are close to default. They have no resources because they couldn’t print money like the United States did, like Europe did during the COVID-19 [pandemic],” the UN chief told Bartiromo. “They have no access to concessional funding because many of them are middle-income countries. Look at small island developing states, the Caribbean islands.”\n\nSome of those countries, he added, “lived on tourism” and “tourism has ended for two years, but as they are middle-income countries, they had no debt to live, they had no concessional funding.”\n\nGuterres said that the United Nations is proposing a global stimulus plan to address economic woes, and claimed that economies should transition from oil and gas to other energy sources. “We need to do that in a just way,” he said, adding that “this transition needs to be well-managed.”\n\nMeanwhile, the West and China need to have “serious” negotiations amid the dim global economic outlook, said the UN chief.\n\nOther WarningsWhile inflation has eased at the consumer and producer level in the United States in recent months, a number of economists and business leaders say that Americans should prepare for a recession starting in 2023. The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates to their highest levels in decades in order to cool high inflation that reached more than 9 percent in June 2022, though it has since dropped to below 7 percent.\n\n“Some economists argue that the strength of the labor market—as well as household balance sheets—will keep the economy strong enough to avoid a recession,” wrote Lakshman Achuthan and Anirvan Banerji, co-founders of the Economic Cycle Research Institute, for CNN’s website. “We disagree,” they wrote, saying that “it remains our expectation that the U.S. economy will enter a recession this year.”\n\n“I’m confident that Microsoft will emerge from this stronger and more competitive,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told employees in a memo on company’s website on Wednesday.\n\nOther tech firms, such as Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, Salesforce, and Twitter, have announced similar moves in recent weeks. Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, had 221,000 full-time employees as of June 30, 2022, according to government filings.",

Putin certainly has the hardware for every scenario.\n\nAt his disposal are an estimated 5,977 warheads, of which 1,600 are ready to be deployed. This terrifying arsenal can be launched from land, submarines and planes.\n\nThey include non-strategic “battlefield” nukes which have a smaller destructive power — and radioactive fallout — and are intended to destroy military capabilities rather than civilian populations. They can be anything from land mines to torpedos.\n\nThey have never been used in combat — so far.\n\nMost read in The Sun\n\nRussia also has the more feared strategic nuclear weapons, which can be launched as warheads on powerful long-range missiles.\n\nThey include intercontinental ballistic missiles which would take just 20 minutes to get to Britain — and 30 to the US. These strategic weapons, with deliberately terrifying names such as Satan, are designed to wipe out entire cities.\n\nUnleashing such weapons would come with a huge amount of risk for Putin. He knows Nato forces have an equally deadly stockpile, with the US retaining 5,428 warheads alongside the UK’s 225 and France’s 290.\n\nBut he may not care about retaliation.\n\nThe Russian leader suggested in 2018 he would be willing to see his homeland destroyed in a nuclear conflict.\n\nHe said: “If someone decides to annihilate Russia, we have the legal right to respond. Yes, it will be a catastrophe for humanity and for the world. But I’m a citizen of Russia and its head of state.\n\n“Why do we need a world without Russia in it?”\n\nThis, though, was clearly a threat to respond in kind if Russia is ever attacked first.\n\nSam Ashworth-Hayes, of the Henry Jackson Society, told The Sun previously: “I think there is only a risk of escalation if Nato forces did directly become involved in the war in Ukraine.\n\n“The message from Vladimir Putin to the West is to stay out of our business, because we will escalate if you interfere.”\n\nNato has made it clear it has no intention of intervening militarily in Ukraine. But one Russian analyst speculated Putin might fire a nuclear warning shot our way.\n\nPavel Felgenhauer, of the independently minded Novaya Gazeta, said: “One option for him is to cut gas supplies to Europe, hoping that will make the Europeans climb down. Another option is to explode a nuclear weapon somewhere over the North Sea between Britain and Denmark — and see what happens.”\n\nAnd US intelligence spies fear Russia might have an “escalate to de-escalate” policy, which means if they should find themselves in conflict with Nato, they would threaten to use low-yield nukes in order to bring a war to an end.\n\n'CONCERNING'\n\nMany wonder whether the former KGB spymaster has become unhinged enough to risk escalating a conflict in this way.\n\nBut one expert believes this could be a ploy. Professor Andrew Wilson, from UCL, said: “Putin is playing a bit on the crazy. The theory goes that if people think I am mad enough to use them then that plays to my advantage.”\n\nHowever, Mr Ashworth-Hayes thinks use of nukes is unlikely. He said: “It is important for people to stay calm. Tensions are very high, but there is no chance of either side launching nuclear weapons.\n\nREAD MORE SUN STORIES\n\n“Both the US and Russia have more than enough warheads to wipe each other out.\n\n“The concept of ‘mutually assured destruction’ still stands.”",

For those of you that have not been paying attention, the apocalyptic alliances that we have been anticipating for years have now formed. It is going to be the U.S. and Europe on one side, and Russia and China will be on the other.

But until that line or boundary, we need virtually everything ... all the way up to sabotage and property destruction.\" (Related: The New York Times similarly promoted \"sabotage\" as the \"most effective\" way to prevent environmental \"breakdown\".)\n\nClimate terrorism is already spreading like wildfire across Europe. In Marseilles, for instance, climate terrorists destroyed a cement factory because they believed it was releasing too much carbon dioxide and warming the planet. In London, climate terrorists threw tomato soup at a Van Gogh's \"Sunflowers\" painting as part of a \"Just Stop Oil\" protest.\n\nThere are not too many of them to begin with across the pond, but SUVs throughout Western Europe are turning up with flat tires as climate terrorists protest other people's use of larger vehicles, which they see as \"gas-guzzlers.\"\n\nThese types of things please Malm, but he craves more destruction. According to him, this is only the beginning of what climate terrorists should be doing every day to stop all use of the earth's natural energy, i.e., natural gas and oil.\n\nThe good news is that many governments are increasing the penalties and punishments for climate terrorism. Just Stop Oil activist Jan Goodey was recently sentenced to six months in prison for disrupting a major London motorway, while a few months earlier a climate terrorist named Deanna \"Violet\" Coco received a 15-month prison sentence for blocking a lane of traffic on the Sydney Harbour Bridge for 28 minutes.\n\n\"That's what always happens when you escalate,\" Malm said smugly on the Bloomberg broadcast. \"As soon as you pose a danger to the system, this is what you'll get in return. And that's a sign that you're doing something good, that you are actually challenging some interests.\"\n\nIn the comments, one reader wrote that he would like to see the punishments for climate terrorism become even more severe.\n\n\"Sentence them to 25 years minimum of extreme hard labor, or make them food for hungry animals,\" this person wrote. \"No animal should ever have to go hungry,\" he added jokingly.\n\nAnother wrote that true ecological activists who simply oppose needless environmental destruction have had their movements hijacked by communists who are running huge propaganda efforts to keep We the People fighting among ourselves as opposed to joining forces against these communists and their violent plans for the world.\n\n\"They are masters of destruction and of propaganda that dupes the masses into fighting among themselves instead of uniting to solve problems for everyone's benefit,\" this person wrote.\n\nWant to keep up with the latest devious machinations of the climate cult?

John Shewchuk, a certified consulting meteorologist.\n\n“NOAA fabricates temperature data for more than 30 percent of the 1,218 USHCN reporting stations that no longer exist.”\n\nHe calls them “ghost” stations.\n\nMr. Shewchuck said USHCN stations reached a maximum of 1,218 stations in 1957, but after 1990 the number of active stations began declining due to aging equipment and personnel retirements.\n\nNOAA still records data from these ghost stations by taking the temperature readings from surrounding stations, and recording their average for the ghost station, followed by an “E,” for estimate.\n\nSo much for “science.”\n\nIf you can’t prove it… just make it up.\n\nThis is from the “trust the science” fools.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at: facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston, or Truth Social @WarnerToddHuston\n\nCross-posted with The Lid\n\nRelated:\n\n- Next Loony Liberal Crusade: They Want to Take Your Coffee Away — For Global Warming, Of Course (Video)\n\n- COP28 Head Tells Crowd There’s “No Science” Backing Phase-Out Of Fossil Fuels To Stop Global Warming\n\n- Norway Study Concludes There Is NO Man-Made Global Warming\n\n- Bill Gates Bankrolling DESTRUCTION OF ALL TREES To Stop “Global Warming” (Video)\n\n- Will Biden Block Sunlight To Cut Global Warming?\n\nTurn your back on Big Tech oligarchs and join the New Resistance NOW!

[bold, links added]\n\n…snip… In separate – and far more provocative -comments made earlier in the day during a JPMorgan investor seminar where he led a fireside chat moderated by JPMorgan’s Gergana Thiel, Dimon made some extremely outspoken comments that you won’t hear on the mainstream media, telling a small group of listeners that was closed to the press that the “President of the United States needs to stand up and say we may not meet our 2050 climate objectives because this is a fucking war.”\n\nHe also said, “time to stop going hat in hand to Venezuela and Saudi and start pumping more oil & gas in the USA.”\n\nEchoing what he has said before, Jamie said this is the way the USA maintains its standing, as the future of the world is by pumping more oil and gas and using energy security to ensure Western unity.\n\nAnd he did say when it comes to ESG that “investors don’t give a shit” warning not to “cede governance to do-gooder kids on a committee.”\n\nFinally, he stressed the need for strong American leadership that is not being provided by either party. His conclusion: the world needs American diplomacy and neither Trump nor Biden can lead the USA.\n\nh/t Rúnar O.\n\nRead rest at ZeroHedge\n\nJoin our list\n\nSubscribe to our mailing list and get interesting stuff and updates to your email inbox.\n\nFundamentally, Mr. Dimon is right. Fossil fuels provide 80% of our domestic primary energy with an ongoing evolution that has taken about 120 years to build our modern, reliable & affordable domestic energy system. The “energy transition” will not be accelerated by government mandate or fiat. It will be dictated by the laws of physics and the energy imperatives of cost, energy/power density, scale & sustainability. So, Joe Biden can madate we will “openly defy gravity by 2050.” That does not mean we can IMPLEMENT it! We’d better get a fully informed, rational and civilzed debate on energy & attendant environmental policy started soon. Otherwise, the average Americans standard of living will continue to head south. Just ask anyone in the EU how the “Green Dream” is working out. With the current policy course, the U.S is only 2-3 years behind the same DISASTOROUS result…\n\nJamie Dimon speaks the truth and the Democrats don’t like that. Lower energy costs would lower inflation, but that would require new refineries and some backing from Washington that gives the explorers and drillers confidence. ESG is a money loser. Avoid any entity that promotes it.\n\nWe wouldn’t have to pay higher prices to gas up our cars and lawnmowers if Biden the Bumbler Had’d canceled the Keystone Pipeline and the ANWR to appease the Eco-Freaks and the Russians/OPEC",

It’s about the people in it getting rich off of an ever-expanding, growing, controlling government.” Well, a solar company in Arizona is receiving hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies this year, the overwhelming majority of its operating profit. That’s right. Your tax dollars are working to prop up a toxic and unreliable energy source under the Biden administration.\n\nHere is the full quote from Rush Limbaugh:\n\nClimate change is not about climate change. It’s about the people in it getting rich off of an ever-expanding, growing, controlling government. It’s all about expanding the government and government control over people. It’s about creating victims. When you successfully turn somebody into a victim, you have automatically made them a dependent on you. You are essentially telling them they have lost the power necessary to solve their own problems. And you create within them a mentality that they can’t overcome their own problem because they’re victims.\n\nThis whole paragraph is absolutely true, but I’m going to focus on the first point made. Climate change certainly allows many young people to feel virtuous for engaging in destructive or pointless demonstrations while they claim that the problems in their lives are caused by some vaguely defined climate catastrophe, one which government has to fix for them. Most of all, however, the climate scam is a way of enriching its proponents in government and business.\n\nRelated: Climate Expert: Gas Car Cancellation Is Intended to End Private Transport\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported July 31 that Arizona-based solar panel manufacturer First Solar “expects to receive as much as $710 million this year—nearly 90% of forecast operating profit—from subsidies the U.S. government rolled out a year ago to encourage domestic renewables production.” WSJ added, “One analyst estimates the incentives could be worth more than $10 billion for the company over the next decade.” Talk about hitting the jackpot.\n\nFrom WSJ:\n\nFirst Solar expects to have as much as a 60% share of the U.S. market for large-scale solar installations this year, largely a result of government policies that are pushing clean-energy developers to buy more made-in-America components.\n\nThe company’s shares have more than doubled to $208.40 in Friday trade since the beginning of 2022, despite a string of earnings disappointments during that period.\n\nThe manufacturer has even announced a new factory.\n\nWhat is not being said here is that solar panels generate lots of toxic waste and are unreliable as an energy source. Also, solar panels have killed billions of birds. Meanwhile, huge swathes of natural scenery and farmland must be ruined to set up solar panels. Solar is also unprofitable when left to survive on its own merits; that’s why so many government subsidies are needed. Solar panels are a terrible choice, both for the environment and for the energy grid. They are not a solution to the fake climate crisis.\n\nAs the above Limbaugh quote noted, it’s a money-making scam.",

Tommy Tuberville: “Climate Change is the Biggest Hoax in the World!… I Would Say “25% of Budget” Goes to It (VIDEO) \n\n Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville joined Steve Bannon on The War Room on Friday following Joe Biden’s incredibly partisan and completely dishonest State of the Union Address to the American people last night in Washington DC.\n\nDuring their discussion, Tommy was asked about the climate change craze. The former Auburn coach did not hold back. Tuberville told the War Room audience, “Climate Change is the biggest hoax in the world.” He then added that he believes around 25% of the budget is dumped into climate change policies.\n\nThere are obviously a whole lot of grifters getting rich of the “hoax.”\n\nThe Democrat Party and their mainstream media will not be pleased with Tommy following his honest assessment of the international scam.\n\nSteve Bannon: Okay, so you’re a common sense guy, right? Big education guy. You’ve been around universities all your life. When you come and hear the presentations, when they come and present to you, is it nonsense? I mean, is it just voodoo?\n\nSen. Tuberville: Oh, the climate, yeah. Oh, it’s biggest hoax in the world. I mean, it’s all a money grab… We come in here at our budgets about near 5 trillion a year. What we run on, we’ve spent since I’ve been here, and I hadn’t voted for any of $7 trillion more than that since we’ve been here. Right. I would say 25% of that, Steve, has gone to climate change. I mean, it is the biggest hoax in the world. I mean, you’ve got this clown Kerry. That John Kerry. He doesn’t know what day it is most of the time. I think he’s right behind Joe Biden, and he’s pushed this narrative along with these money grabbers like Clinton and Gore and all the Democrats. I mean, it is all a money grab. This EV car system, you’re seeing it now. It’s crashing, crashing, burning. They can’t get anything out of the solar, no wind…\n\n…I lived in West Texas, coach at university at Texas Tech. I had a wind turbine, huge one, in my backyard, a couple hundred yards.

You just have to take a deep breath sometimes and see how deep of hole these people have dug themselves.\n\nSteve Bannon: Have they presented you any information or data or analysis that would make you say, some of this climate change stuff might be logical, or is it just all presented as essentially financial, economic voodoo?\n\nSen. Tuberville: Yeah, they don’t know enough about it. Now, you can get some of these big scientists who come in and try to push, but you look at the graphs and the narratives that they bring in… It’s a hoax. I’m telling you, it is a huge hoax.

        "text": "NYC to begin tracking food purchases to make sure residents don’t consume “too much” meat \n\n\nJust as he promised to do, New York City Mayor Eric Adams, a left-wing Democrat, is going after people’s meat with new plans to save the world from “climate change” by forcing everyone to become a “plant-based” vegetarian or vegan.\n\nAlong with representatives from the Mayor’s Office of Food Policy and the Mayor’s Office of Climate & Environmental Justice, Adams has announced the launch of a new “carbon footprint” and household food consumption tracking scheme that aims to reduce the Big Apple’s “carbon emissions” by 33 percent by the year 2030.\n\n\nIn order to cut all that carbon, Adams and his allies are imposing new “caps on meat” that, as the name suggests, will limit the amount of meat that New Yorkers are allowed to purchase and consume at public institutions – and eventually within their own homes as well.\n\n(Related: Last month, we warned you that Adams was planning to unleash a horrific new food policing apparatus against New Yorkers, and now he has.)\n\nEric Adams wants all New Yorkers to become vegans\n\nAt a pre-Earth Day event held at a Brooklyn culinary center run by NYC Health + Hospitals, the city’s public health care system, Adams unveiled a chart depicting New York City’s greenhouse gas inventory. This inventory supposedly tracks the carbon footprint generated by household food consumption.\n\nWith the help of American Express, C40 Cities, and EcoData, Adams revealed carbon emissions data about household food consumption, which was added to existing carbon emissions data on energy use, transportation, and waste.\n\nCommissioner Rohit Aggarwala from the NYC Department of Environmental Protection unveiled the new household food consumption data. Aggarwala, by the way, also founded the Google smart city subsidiary Sidewalk Labs, which collects data in order to forge “a new standard for what cities have to do” as a novel way to shape policy.\n\nWhile the inventory that Aggarwala presented will also now include greenhouse gas “pollution” from the production and consumption of consumer goods like clothing, air travel, and health care, Adams focused his efforts at the event specifically on the foods that New Yorkers consume – mainly meat and dairy, which he personally opposes.\n\n“Food is the third-biggest source of cities’ emissions right after buildings and transportation, but all food is not created equal,” Adams unsubstantially stated. “The vast majority of food that is contributing to our emission crisis lies in meat and dairy products.”\n\n“It is easy to talk about the emissions that’s coming from buildings and how it impacts our environment, but we now have to talk about beef. And I don’t know if people are ready for this conversation.”\n\nOther than fish, Adams reportedly abides by a “plant-based” vegan diet, which he says helped him overcome diabetes. He wrote a vegan cookbook to promote his personal dietary choices, which he now wants all New Yorkers to follow in order to stop “global warming.”\n\n“We already know that a plant-powered diet is better for your physical and mental health, and I am living proof of that,” Adams declared. “But the reality is that thanks to this new inventory, we’re finding out it is better for the planet.”\n\nThe simplistic way in which Adams couched his argument against meat and dairy has already been debunked by people who are actually educated in such things, including Melissa McKendree, PhD, an agricultural economist at Michigan State University.\n\n“Different meats have different kinds of greenhouse gas footprints,” McKendree clarified about how pasture-raised animals do not harm the environment like feedlot animals do. “All land is not created equal.”",

        "text": "INSPIRED BY WASHINGTON KIEV INCREASES TERRORIST ATTACKS IN RUSSIA \n\n\nThe Washington Post has recently revealed the long-known fact that the Ukrainian special services are behind the terrorist attacks on Russian territory. Moreover, Ukrainian terrorists were praised for progress they made during the years-long cooperation with their partners in the US. Inspired by fame, the Kiev regime doubled its efforts to launch more attacks against the Russians. In recent days alone, a lot of the attacks failed but some were partially successful.\n\nOn the morning of October 27, pro-Russian politician Oleg Tsarev was targeted with an assassination attempt in Crimea. He was shot and hospitalized with heavy wounds. The victim has been a deputy of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine since 2002. In 2014, he supported the referendum on independence in Donbass and served as the speaker of the Parliament of Novorossiya.\n\nUnfortunately, Oleg Tsarev was far from the first victim of the Nazi Kiev regime, which has been hunting for politicians, journalists and public figures because of their positions for more than a decade.\n\nKiev also continues attempts to launch terrorist attacks in various cities of Russia. Their goals are to inflict civilian casualties and threaten the population, as well as to discredit the Russian authorities and create the appearance of a national resistance against the Kremlin. To do this, Kiev recruits naive men, often Ukrainians who have moved to Russia, who for monetary rewards go to a life of crime and sacrifice their lives.\n\nOn October 26, the FSB announced the elimination of a Ukrainian agent who wanted to stage a terrorist attack on one of the military enlistment offices in Tver.\n\nThe man was a member of some “Ukrainian nationalist formation”. He provided Kiev with data on military, fuel and energy facilities in the region. During the arrest, the man resisted and was killed. The FSB seized homemade explosives and an RGD-5 grenade on the spot.\n\nMilitary enlistment offices are frequently targeted by the Ukrainian special services. Kiev is trying to create the appearance that Russian men do not want to fight and resist the Kremlin’s policies.\n\nCases have become frequent when Ukrainian scammers under various pretexts forced women to set fire to military enlistment offices in different Russian cities. For example, victims were assured that they should stage the attack to check the effectiveness of local emergency services and so on.\n\nSometimes Kiev shows more ingenuity to assure Washington that the years of training and funding have not passed for nothing.\n\nFor example, a Ukrainian who has been living with his family in Moscow for many years recently tried to poison Russian pilots. Disguised as a courier, he delivered a poisoned cake to their holiday. However, the operation failed, and now the Ukrainian agent will be arrested in a criminal case. Meanwhile, his Ukrainian and American curators will have to search for more naive victims in Russia.",

It’s what you get when you put the children in charge.” ( – Joseph Toomey, below)\n\nTalented amateurs are often better than the ‘professionals’ when it comes to dissecting U.S. energy policy. Or maybe I have it reversed. The pros are those in the trenches and the amateurs are the ones on high.\n\nSo let’s call Joseph Toomey, independent management consultant, an expert. Here is his recent post about the much-in-the-news problems of the offshore wind industry under Biden Energy Policy.\n\nNot long ago, this thread reiterated a resolute, long-standing belief that Offshore Wind is neither practical nor affordable, even in high-tax Democrat-governed Blue States of the U.S. Northeast and Middle Atlantic regions. Four proposed Offshore Wind projects had collapsed into miserable failure after project sponsors demanded increased public subsidies of as much as 65% above the already wildly-inflated feed-in prices they had previously been promised by New York State.\n\nJust this week, it was New Jersey’s turn to be left looking like adolescents for pretending that Offshore Wind could ever become a viable option for supplying the electricity needs of that state’s ratepayers at affordable levels.\n\nNote the delicious fury from New Jersey’s Governor Phil Murphy who proclaimed that:\n\n“Today’s decision by Ørsted to abandon its commitments to New Jersey is outrageous and calls into question the company’s credibility and competence.”\n\nIt was Murphy himself whose competence had been called into question by backing these wildly infeasible ideas.\n\nIf this sounds a little too much like a “Spike the Football” moment for our valuable readership, you have my deepest condolences. I just fell off my armchair laughing at the hilarious incompetence of our renewable energy-promoting political class. The day can’t come soon enough when real adults return into leadership positions to pull humanity back from the brink of extinction events that actually exist, as recent troubling global developments adequately demonstrate.\n\nThe Biden administration’s preposterous plan to establish 30,000 megawatts of nameplate Offshore Wind capacity by 2030 was always a pipedream. It’s what you get when you put the children in charge.\n\nThe badly-needed adult supervision delivered by marketplace realities has now demonstrated to sentient humans that there was never a chance in the whole universe that Biden’s absurd plan could ever be realized.\n\nActivate to view larger image,\n\nComments on Post\n\nSome of the many comments that followed either confirmed the obvious or suggested the way forward.\n\nThe obvious from Robert Borlick: “Notice how many days with no output? This is why wind needs to be backed up with dependable generators that can be ramped up to serve the load.”\n\nThe way forward from Ken Urkosky: “All this subsidy funding should go to building infrastructure capable of withstanding the harsher weather events we’re told to expect! That would be much more effective in reducing the impacts of climate change vs trying to control our Earth’s climate.”\n\nAnd Borlick, an important voice in the electricity debate, has had enough with offshore wind:\n\nI strongly opposed the OSW projects that were approved by the Maryland Public Service Commission in 2017 and again in 2021. Both awards violated Maryland law by not conducting valid cost-benefit analyses, which would have eliminated all but one project (US Wind). I tried to persuade the Maryland People’s Counsel to sue the MPSC but they wimped out – both times.\n\nNow the crazies in the Maryland legislature want to approve even more OSW but this time they want to hide the huge subsidies by paying them out of general tax revenues, instead of through the more visible electricity rate increases.\n\nMy hope is that cost increases will kill the Maryland projects just as they did the New Jersey projects.\n\nThe last word goes to engineer Greg Gardner: “BUT, it made a lot of congresspersons rich… that was the real plan.”",

It caused fears that the move will lead to a prolonged supply halt.\n\nThe report mentioned that benchmark futures rose toward 300 euros a megawatt hour. The electricity and coal prices also surge to fresh records.\n\nThe recent developments show that the Europeans are preparing for a difficult winter without gas supplies from Russia. It is part of the fallout from the war in Ukraine, which started after Russia announced the invasion of its neighbouring country on February 24.\n\nIn the report, it is mentioned that the key Nord Stream pipeline will stop for three days of maintenance on August 31.

No date was given for when the existing plants would have to go, but other Biden regulatory actions and international commitments already in the works had meant no coal by 2035.\n\nThis is crazy and fascistic, as he calls for the elimination of a vital energy resource.\n\nJohn Kerry demands the end of coal plants.— Daniel Turner (@DanielTurnerPTF) December 4, 2023\n\nHere's what Kerry won't tell you:\n\n- Coal is inexpensive, abundant, and reliable\n\n- Solar manufacturing plants run on coal\n\n- Wind manufacturing plants run on coal\n\n- EV battery factories are powered by coal\n\nFacts matter. pic.twitter.com/V8cX2injQu\n\nKerry says there shouldn't be any more permanent coal-fired power plants permitted anywhere in the world. He said that's how you can do something for \"health.\" He said he finds himself getting more and more \"militant\" because he does not understand \"how adults [who] are in positions of responsibility can be avoiding responsibility for taking away those things that are killing people on a daily basis. And the reality is that the climate crisis and the health crisis are one and the same.\"\n\nYikes! How dare anyone disagree with him, he seemingly thinks, while he's trying to crush industries and the jobs associated with them? We get that the Biden team doesn't care about that, as they race pell-mell ahead with their agenda.\n\nBut it gets worse, as Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY) and Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) point out. While the Biden team is pushing for this radical agenda that would limit and harm the U.S., Kerry gave China a pass by locking them into the status of a \"developing country\" according to the Paris Agreement, which Kerry helped to negotiate.\n\n“At the time the Paris Agreement was signed, China was the world’s second largest economy, and had been so for many years. Nevertheless, the treaty you negotiated and agreed to locked into place China’s status as a developing country. That was as absurd then as it is now,” the senators wrote. [....]\n\n“China is bent on global domination. It is the world’s second largest economy and largest emitter of greenhouse gases. It is America’s chief economic and geopolitical rival. It exploits forced labor. It manipulates global markets. It steals our technology. It is building hypersonic missiles and a blue-water navy,” the senators wrote. “It should not get special treatment in international climate agreements. There should be no more free rides for China. That should be non-negotiable.”\n\nBut it's the Biden team, where giving China a pass seems to be baked in, so they're building all the coal plants they can. And they're using them to help build all the green energy stuff that the Biden team wants to shove down our throats.\n\nChina is acting within, and taking advantage of, the international framework you helped create—the Paris Agreement. The Chinese coal plants to which you object now power mines and refineries producing critical minerals. They drive factories building solar panels, wind turbines, and electric batteries and cars that the Biden Administration wants to force Americans to buy.\n\nSo it's a double win for China, courtesy of the Biden administration.

        "text": "Green propaganda is masking real statistics \n\n The Royal College of Physicians has abandoned science, and become a green ideological campaigning organisation.\n\nThe RCP’s “green physician toolkit” is precisely the same patronising nonsense as the WHO’s toolkit of the same name, discussed in my Daily Sceptic article a few months ago.\n\nThe two main ideas behind the toolkit are\n\na) that doctors routinely make “unnecessary” decisions that have environmental impact, and that\n\nb) they should use their authority to advance an ideological agenda.\n\nFor example “reduce blood testing where clinically appropriate”. This assumes that doctors test people’s blood frivolously, something equivalent to an “unnecessary journey”. Very, very odd.\n\nBut the most egregious claim, of course, is that “Climate change is one of the biggest threats to human health”.\n\nThat is so far from truthful, and so utterly embedded in green ideology, that the word “lie” is not sufficient.\n\nThere is less than zero evidence that climate is a “threat to human health”, let alone the “biggest threat”. The evidence debunking the link between climate change and health is so strong that doctors have to go out of their way to conceal the stats.\n\nYou can see the raw data here for yourself. Climate-related mortality has fallen in recent decades. Diseases of poverty, which are claimed to be climate-linked, including malaria, are also in steep decline.\n\nI give an overview of how climate-activist doctors at the Lancet are influenced by ideology here, and go into more detail to explain how they lie in this presentation below. At around 36 mins, I show that the Lancet’s green propaganda pages hide the mortality statistics behind “frequency of event” statistics, to give the opposite impression.\n\nThe Lancet claims that “life-threatening extreme weather events are becoming increasingly frequent”. When you interrogate the data, however, it reveals that far fewer people are being killed by extreme weather.\n\nSo it’s not just a lie, it’s a fraud. And it’s a fraud told for political effect, to transform society and the economy, which ultimately will have a devastating effect on human health. And it already is, if we calculate the opportunity cost for people in emerging economies.\n\nDoctors and medical researchers involved in this propaganda have invented their own metric of “risk” to create “evidence” of a growing “threat”. And doctors and institutions of medicine that reproduce this propaganda do so *uncritically* without checking the numbers.\n\nThe numbers are not complicated. The science is not complicated. The data is not hard to find. This is not like 5-sigma high energy physics experimentation.\n\nConsider this chart from the latest Lancet propaganda report, for example. It claims that the better part of a $trillion is lost from agricultural production because of exposure to heat. But look at how small that effect is in the West, compared to developing/low income economies.\n\nWhereas farmers in the US can tend to vast farms, sitting in GPS-guided, air conditioned, diesel-powered tractors, subsistence agriculture is dawn-to-dusk manual labour.\n\nThe difference is access to fossil fuels. It’s not a weather or climate effect.\n\nTo frame that disparity between agricultural producers in the richest and poorest economies as one of “climate change”, requiring the abolition of fossil fuels is a grotesque injustice. It is vile.",

        "text": "Despite Yields Doubling, NYTimes Claims Vanilla Is Disappearing From Climate Change \n\n The New York Times is attempting to stoke climate alarm this week with an article claiming the world’s favorite scent – vanilla – is about to disappear because climate change is eradicating vanilla plants. [emphasis, links added]\n\nIn reality, objective data show vanilla production has doubled since the year 2000, and the current market is saturated with oversupply.\n\nThe Times article, “This Is How the World’s Favorite Scent Disappears,” notes vanilla is the world’s favorite scent and is used in a wide variety of perfumes and other products.\n\nCiting anecdotal events like a cyclone that hit Madagascar several years ago during its annual cyclone season, the Times claims supersized cyclones are putting vanilla plants on the verge of extinction.\n\nInterestingly, although the Times published its article just yesterday, the best anecdotal “evidence” for the asserted vanilla extinction was a cyclone that hit Madagascar way back in 2017 during its cyclone season.\n\nAccording to the Times, Madagascar produces 80 percent of the world’s vanilla – actually, it produces significantly less than 80 percent – and:\n\n“As a result [of the 2017 cyclone], the price of vanilla bean pods surged to nearly $300 a pound. The increasingly erratic weather, along with pressure to cut the forests that harbor the orchids, is particularly worrisome for farmers…”\n\nSo, why does the Times provide just anecdotal ‘evidence’ of climate change ravaging vanilla crops, and why does the Times have to go back to 2017 to find any such anecdotal evidence?\n\nThe answer is that objective facts expose the Times’ claim as false.\n\nThe United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization provides detailed information on global crop production, including vanilla. According to the UN data, global vanilla production has doubled from 3.9 million kg of vanilla in 2000 to 7.7 million kg in 2022.\n\nThere is so much vanilla being produced that farmers are complaining about low vanilla prices caused by overproduction.\n\n“The 2023 vanilla crop is expected to be one of the best harvests in the last two decades, forecasted at 2,500 tons with exceptionally high quality,” observes the Nielsen-Massey 2023 Crop Report.\n\nThe Crop Report observes that recent strong production has created a market oversupply. “The oversupply has led to aggressive price reductions, posing economic challenges for vanilla farmers as they sell their 2022 crop at low prices to meet their daily living needs,” the Crop Report adds.\n\nWow, talk about the New York Times getting the story completely backward and wrong!\n\nThe New York Times points to a cyclone that hit Madagascar seven years ago during its cyclone season and caused a very short-term spike in vanilla prices.\n\nThat is its sole “evidence” of climate change making vanilla go extinct.\n\nIn reality, vanilla production is so strong that the market is saturated with vanilla, … making farmers complain about low prices.\n\nThe New York Times and other “mainstream” media outlets have a long history of identifying popular foods, beverages, and luxury items that climate change is allegedly destroying.\n\nAs is the case with all other such items that have come to Climate Realism’s attention, vanilla is becoming more abundant rather than less abundant as the planet modestly warms.\n\nTop photo of the Vanilla bean plant by Kristy An on Unsplash",

        "text": "The Planet is Warming So Hand Over Your Wallet and Get Used to Sitting in the Dark \n\n The climate change lobby is blissfully unaware of the consequences of being wrong. We are constantly reminded that higher electric bills are for our own good or that living with less is a moral choice. Most of us get poorer, but those who bet on carbon reduction and electric cars are making a killing.\n\nThere's a story, perhaps apocryphal, that during the siege of Stalingrad, children were given prizes of small pieces of cake for every rat they were able to catch. At the rate our civilization is going, we may be holding similar contests before too long.\n\nPolitical scientist Roger Pielke Jr. notes, \"It's quite intuitive for people to understand that there's a lot of power in solar energy. We feel the wind. The idea that you can get something for nothing, people find enormously appealing.\"\n\nExcept it's not \"something for nothing.\" And we're paying extra for \"renewable energy\" despite all the promises.\n\nCalifornia now requests all new homes to have solar panels. John Stossel points out that in addition to the solar panels, \"all new cars sold in 2035 to be zero emission, and all the state's electricity to come from carbon-free resources by 2045.\" Anyone who questions this orthodoxy is dismissed as a crank.\n\nBut the fact is that we're hurtling toward a future where our energy needs are going to far exceed our ability to supply energy at any price. The reason is that we are deliberately removing viable choices for energy creation to \"save the planet.\"\n\nCalifornia is getting results in its renewable experiments. The problem is that they're not good results and only promise to get worse.\n\nPeople in Washington state pay about 11 cents per kilowatt-hour. In Oregon, 13 cents. In California, now almost 30 cents.\n\nDo they at least get reliable energy for that? No.\n\nThe big problem with wind and solar power, of course, is that they don't work when the wind doesn't blow or the sun doesn't shine. Sometimes that happens when people most want heat or air conditioning.\n\nIncreased use of \"renewables\" is why blackouts are more common in California. Bloomenergy says there were over 25,000 in 2019—thousands more than the previous year.\n\n\"We failed to predict and plan,\" said Gov. Gavin Newsom. Right.\n\nInstead, they embraced unscientific green fantasies.\n\nOnly by the grace of God and flyover country voting for Republicans have we been able to avoid the fate of Californians. But the California contagion will spread unless we're more vigilant. Biden has already relaxed his electric car mandate that would have required 67% of new cars sold by 2035 to be EVs after pressure from the auto unions. But other mandates on emissions remain.\n\nThis next election will determine whether we're going to have abundant energy for our future or whether our kids will become expert rat catchers.",

I suggest we learn from the source.”\n\nAsked whether the draft treaty could serve as a basis for further peace talks, Peskov said Kiev’s public position was to reject talks with Russia. The idea of reviving the failed agreement was floated by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko when he met Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin earlier this month.\n\nJohnson has denied derailing the peace talks, but has also bragged on multiple occasions about his policy of nudging Kiev into continuing hostilities with Russia, which the British politician claims to be a fight for global democracy.\n\n“There could be no more effective way of investing in Western security than investing in Ukraine, because those guys without a single pair of American boots on the ground are fighting for the West,” Johnson told students at Georgetown University during a visit to the US this month. The Ukrainians “are effectively fighting our own fight, fighting for our own interests,” he added.\n\nRussian officials have described the Ukraine conflict as a Western proxy war against Moscow, which the US and its allies allegedly intend to wage “to the last Ukrainian.” Their goal, according to Moscow, is to contain Russia and stall its development, rather than protect the interests of the Ukrainian people.",

        "text": "How Nikita Khrushchev Exposed the Hypocrisy of US Interventions \n\n For American interventionists living today, all that one needs to know is that Russia invaded Ukraine. End of story. Black and white. Russia bad. Ukraine good. Support Ukraine with U.S. taxpayer-funded cash and armaments. America good.\n\nIf we go back to the Cuban Missile Crisis, we find that things are not so simple, especially for American interventionists, even if they don’t realize it.\nThe Soviets had installed nuclear missiles in Cuba that had the capability of hitting U.S. cities along the Eastern seaboard, including Washington, D.C., and New York City. The crisis lasted from October 16 through October 29, 1962.\n\nPresident Kennedy demanded that the Soviets remove their nuclear missiles from Cuba and take them back to the Soviet Union. The Pentagon was exerting enormous pressure on Kennedy to immediately initiate a surprise bombing attack on the suspected missile sites, followed by a full-scale regime-change military invasion of the island. In other words, they were pressuring Kennedy to do to Cuba what Russia has done to Ukraine. In fact, the pressure they placed on Kennedy was so intense that Robert Kennedy, the president’s brother, secretly told Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin “If the situation continues much longer, the President is not sure that the military will not overthrow him and seize power.”\n\nOn October 27 — two days before the crisis was resolved — Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev wrote a letter to Kennedy stating the following:\nBut how are we, the Soviet Union, our Government, to assess your actions, which are expressed in the fact that you have surrounded the Soviet Union with military bases; surrounded our allies with military bases; placed military bases literally around our country; and stationed your missile armaments there? This is no secret. Responsible American personages openly declare that it is so. Your missiles are located in Britain, are located in Italy, and are aimed against us. Your missiles are located in Turkey.\n\nYou are disturbed over Cuba. You say that this disturbs you because it is 90 miles by sea from the coast of the United States of America. But Turkey adjoins us; our sentries patrol back and forth and see each other. Do you consider, then, that you have the right to demand security for your own country and the removal of the weapons you call offensive, but do not accord the same right to us? You have placed destructive missile weapons, which you call offensive, in Turkey, literally next to us. How then can recognition of our equal military capacities be reconciled with such unequal relations between our great states? This is irreconcilable.\n\nDo you see the problem? Khrushchev was pointing out the hypocrisy of the U.S. position, a position that American interventionists today simply cannot recognize, owing to their blind allegiance to the U.S. national-security establishment.\n\nThe fact is that the Soviets had the legal authority to place their nuclear missiles in Cuba, just as Ukraine has the legal authority to join NATO. Cuba, like Ukraine, is a sovereign, independent country and, therefore, had the legal authority to permit the Soviets to install their missiles in Cuba, just as Ukraine has the legal authority to permit the U.S. and NATO to install their nuclear missiles in Ukraine.\n\nBut even though such legal authority exists, no one, including both Russians and Americans, likes to have nuclear missiles pointed at himself, especially from just a few miles away. This is the point that Kennedy was making when he stood fast during the Cuban Missile Crisis. With the full support of the Pentagon and the CIA, he was willing to risk all-out nuclear war to force the Soviets to remove those missiles, even though he knew that the Soviets had the legal authority to install them in Cuba. He, the Pentagon, and the CIA simply did not like the fact that those missiles were so close to the United States.\n\nBut that’s precisely how the Soviets felt as well, which is what Khrushchev was expressing in his letter to Kennedy. He was essentially saying, “Hey, you don’t like our missiles in Cuba because they are so close to your country. That’s exactly how we feel as well, not only about your missiles over here that are painted at us but also about all your military bases with which you have surrounded us. How come you can’t understand that?”\n\nWell, Kennedy did come to understand that. That’s how he and Khrushchev were able to strike a deal, one that infuriated the U.S. national-security establishment as well as American interventionists.\nThe deal consisted of two major parts: First, Kennedy vowed that he would not permit the Pentagon and the CIA to again invade Cuba and, second, Kennedy agreed to withdraw U.S. nuclear missiles in Turkey that were pointed at Russia.\n\nThe Joint Chiefs of Staff were livid. They considered Kennedy’s resolution of the crisis to be the worst defeat in U.S history. They compared his actions during the crisis to Neville Chamberlain’s appeasement of Hitler at Munich.\n\nFor their part, American interventionists were also furious over Kennedy’s resolution of the crisis. As far as they were concerned, the Pentagon and the CIA had the “right” to install their nuclear missiles wherever they want and the Soviets did not have the “right” to do the same. It’s a position that American interventionists still hold today.\n\nCan you see why American interventionists hated Kennedy so much and why the Pentagon and the CIA ultimately concluded that he constituted a grave threat to “national security”?",

Commentary in Asia Times has concluded that this flurry of activity is in response to how badly things are going on the battlefield. Washington has invested many tens of billions of dollars into what's clearly a 'proxy war' against Russia. Asia Times wrote:\n\nWednesday, November 15th is Z-Day for the War in Ukraine. CIA Chief William Burns will arrive in Kiev for urgent, secret meetings with Zelensky. It is worth asking: How come Burns is on an urgent mission to Ukraine?\n\nThe answer to the question is that Ukraine is imploding. The crumbling of the Zelensky regime is unsurprising: Ukraine has been sustaining far too many casualties to survive for much longer. Ukraine either must find a way to make a deal with Russia or face an internal rebellion.\n\nIndeed, there have been recent media rumors and rumblings that Washington has begun to quietly push Kiev to the negotiating table. Was this in any way the focus of these new visits by Burns and Austin?\n\n\"The Russian strategy is to bleed-down Ukraine’s armed forces and create a political crisis in Kiev,\" the Asia Times report continued. \"The Russian effort is ahead of schedule, which has surprised Moscow as much as Washington.\"\n\nZelensky has lately sacked and replaced many within his own war cabinet. All of this is a sign of deepening friction, also as Zelensky has admitted that the Gaza crisis has taken the international attention off of Ukraine's war efforts. This has led to waning monetary and weapons support as well.",

From Al Gore's mansion to John Kerry's private jets to Leonardo DiCaprio's mega-yacht, these people are all really big on \"Do as we say, not as we do.\"\n\nAnd it's worth digging a little deeper into the issues behind the net-zero issue, that being the advocacy for net zero carbon emissions, something that is all but impossible. Why? Because of the things required for the manufacture of electric vehicles (EVs); specifically, their batteries and, even more specifically, the raw materials required to make those batteries.\n\nThis brings us to Indonesia and the environmental havoc that mining for nickel, an essential component of EV batteries, is wreaking on that country.\n\nSwathes of rainforest and coastal communities are being destroyed by a nickel mining boom in Indonesia sparked by the race to transition away from fossil fuels.\n\nAcross the country, a major drive to exploit the country’s abundant natural resources is underway. These photographs capture the sheer scale of the production process.\n\nRows of chimneys, belching smoke and fumes, tower over the schools and houses of what were once rural communities in scenes recalling the work of L.S. Lowry, whose paintings captured life in the industrial districts of North West England in the mid-20th century.\n\nIndonesia is now the world’s largest nickel producer, with 15 per cent of the globe’s lateritic nickel resources – typically low-grade deposits found near the surface.\n\nBut demand is still soaring in tandem with the rise of the electric vehicles (EVs), which depend on it for their batteries.\n\nGuess who is, in large part, funding all this?\n\nBillion dollar Chinese firms anchor the nickel market in Indonesia, but they are often fed cheap ore by hundreds of smaller, mostly locally-owned mines that dot the rainforest. These mines have transformed once-peaceful agrarian villages and communities, providing economic opportunity but a health and environmental crisis looms from pollution.\n\nIn just three years, Indonesia has signed more than a dozen deals worth more than $15 billion for battery materials and electric vehicle production with global manufacturers including Hyundai, LG and Foxconn.\n\nGranted, nickel extraction will probably go on regardless of the EV push, regardless of the net-zero goals of climate scolds, and we should remember that extraction and refining bring jobs to impoverished communities in Indonesia. That's not the point that we should be examining here.\n\nIt's the hypocrisy of the climate scolds ignoring these inescapable consequences of their agenda that's galling.\n\nSee Related: Tax Cuts for the Rich? Clean Energy Credits Mostly Go to Higher-Income Filers\n\nMUST WATCH: Guyana President Lights Up BBC Host Who Tries to Climate Shame Him Over Extracting Oil\n\nThat's always been the whole problem with these people; they never count the cost, all the costs, of the agenda for which they advocate. They are of a kind with (and in many cases are the same people) who complain about, say, my going into the woods to shoot a grouse or a snowshoe hare for supper, demanding to know why I can't get my meat at a grocery store so no animal has to die. They are of a kind with the \"Stop Oil\" protesters who block traffic for hours, forcing people to sit with their car engines idling, pouring still more exhaust into the air. They are of a kind with the Greta Thunbergs of the world, ill-informed scolds who want to dictate the end of our modern, technological lifestyles.\n\nThey never figure situations like the mining of nickel for EV batteries in Indonesia into their calculus, any more than they account for the mining of cobalt with slave labor in Congo, or mining for lithium and its accompanying environmental disturbance.\n\nTo put it bluntly, they are hypocrites of the worst sort. Why do they ignore these problems with their policies?

Feel free to repost and share widely Global Research articles.\n\nIn a recently unearthed video of the College of Global Public Health Center for Bioethics at New York University Director, Dr. Matthew Liao, speaking at the 2016 World Science Festival, he openly advocates artificially inducing a red meat allergy in the entire human population, using an analog of the algha-gal molecule found in the Lone Star Tick that I have documented previously at Armageddon Prose, so as to fight “climate change.”\n\n\n“People eat too much meat. And if they were to cut down on their consumption on meat, then it would actually really help the planet.\n\nBut people are not willing to give up meat. Some people will be willing to, but other people – they may be willing to but they have a weakness of will. They say ‘this steak is just too juicy, I can’t do that.’ I’m one of those by the way.\n\nSo here’s a thought. So it turns out that we know a lot about — we have these intolerances… For example, I have a milk intolerance. And some people are intolerant to crayfish. So possibly we can use human engineering to make the case that we’re intolerant to certain kinds of meat, to certain kinds of bovine proteins…\n\nThere’s this thing called the Lone Star tick where if it bites you, you will become allergic to meat… So that’s something we can do through human engineering. We can possibly address really big world problems through human engineering.”\n\nThis level of evil – openly plotting to trigger autoimmune disease in humans without their consent at the population level – is nearly unspeakable.\n\nAt the same forum, Liao advocated “editing” humans to become “so small that we get eaten by cats,” again for the sake of “climate change.”\n\nWere these psychopaths to succeed with this and any of their many other bioengineering projects under the guises of Public Health™, fighting “climate change,” etc., then nothing the Third Reich did, or even fantasized doing in Dr. Mengele’s wildest dreams, to the undesirables would remotely compare.\n\nThis is a war – of a different kind than we have seen historically – “unrestricted warfare,” as the CCP calls it — but a war nonetheless. As such, we need Nuremberg II now. People like Matthew Liao are not civilians; they must be reclassified as enemy combatants and given military tribunal trials.\n\nI don’t know how this is going to be politically feasible, given the highly controlled and totally compromised political machine in the US and across the West, “penetrated” by the WEF, in the words of Klaus Schwab, as they are.",

Healthcare information once hacked is not reversible.\n\n“Simply changing someone’s birthday is enough to disrupt the entire US online health system and fixing it would be very, very difficult.”\n\nThe expert said that a potential cyberattack on institutions would be “more crippling” than a terrorist attack.\n\nShe added: “9/11 was a shock event. It was traumatic as we had never seen anything like it before.\n\nMost read in Tech\n\n“But, the real disruption to people, companies, and systems of governance is going to be a cyberattack.”\n\nIn June 2017, the Health Care Industry Cybersecurity Task Force warned in a report that healthcare cybersecurity is in a “critical condition”.\n\nThe dossier stated: “Healthcare cybersecurity is a key public health concern that needs immediate and aggressive attention.”\n\nResearchers at the computer hardware company IBM say that healthcare firms on average take around 236 days to detect a data breach, and 93 days to mitigate the damage.\n\nThis compares to the average of 207 days to identify and 73 days to contain a cyberattack.\n\n'EASY TARGETS'\n\nAnd, US hospitals have around 10-15 networked medical devices per bed on average, meaning officials are working to secure machinery that’s easy to breach, according to Wired.\n\nAnalysts at the Brookings Institute believe “the fate of healthcare security” depends on whether investments in cybersecurity are made.\n\nThey said: “Just as a responsible healthcare professional seeks to identify and treat patients’ underlying chronic conditions before they cause a serious medical emergency, so too must responsible healthcare organizations address vulnerabilities in their digital infrastructure to prevent cyberattacks.\"\n\nFears of a potential cyberattack on US institutions are rising amid the crisis in Ukraine.\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security officials warned that the US is on “heightened alert” for a potential cyberattack from Moscow.\n\nRehman believes an attack on the US is \"highly likely\" should the crisis in Eastern Europe escalate.\n\nPentagon officials warned Friday that a Russian invasion of Ukraine would result in a \"horrific\" aftermath.\n\nMoscow has amassed around 100,000 troops at the Ukrainian border - something which Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he hadn't seen in the past four decades.\n\nRehman said: “A US response would probably set off what we believe will be the world’s first large-scale cyberwar.\n\nUS IN 'WARFARE STATE'\n\n“The Russians have been doing cyber-espionage and pre-positioning operations – meaning they’re setting up vulnerabilities in our infrastructure which means when they’re ready, they can release. It might not necessarily be tomorrow.”\n\nR.P. Eddy, CEO of the cybersecurity firm Ergo, warned that the US is already in a “warfare state” with Moscow, Fox News reports.\n\nHe told governors: “What’s Russia’s next move?

The transition should have been a nonstarter. It's riddled with numerous deal killers. It's like having a dozen fatal diseases all at the same time.\"\n\n(Related: Learn more about why EVs have been a scam from the very beginning.)\n\nIn a piece he wrote for the Climate Change Dispatch that was also picked up by Climate Depot, Ross explains at great length what would need to be in place just to create the possibility that a nationwide fleet of 100 percent EVs would work.\n\nFor one, energy generation and grid expansion would need to at least double, and very quickly. With the arbitrary deadlines the greenies have put in place, one of the big ones being Agenda 2030, that type of rapid expansion is simply impossible.\n\nThere is a reason why there was never any market research or feasibility studies done on the EV transition. Had they been, the results would have shown what we are now all finding out in real time: that EVs are a lost cause.\n\n\"The electric vehicle honeymoon is over,\" Ross contends. \"Don't expect the marriage itself to last much longer either.\"\n\nAnother thing the greenies never considered is the lengthy charging times for EVs. While a gas-powered vehicle can be refilled with gas at any one of the tens of thousands of gas stations that dot the United States landscape, EVs take hours to charge – assuming you can even find a charger.\n\nSomeone with an EV who lives in California, for instance, would not even make it through Arizona, let alone all the way through Texas, if they were, say, taking a road trip to Florida.\n\n\"Did they truly believe everyone would tolerate spending hours to charge their vehicles rather than the minutes they were accustomed to?\" Ross asks.\n\nSales data clearly shows that the American public is simply not interested, either due to cost or impracticality, in buying an EV. Heck, even car rental companies are having trouble getting their customers to rent an EV for a day or two, let alone buy one.\n\nEven so, car manufacturers are continuing to ramp up EV production. This means that, in time, there will be EV graveyards full of unsold EVs, resulting in untold billions of dollars in losses and serious economic repercussions.\n\n\"We are spending trillions on a fabricated dream, all for imaginary payoffs decades in the future,\" Ross writes.\n\n\"When the EV house of cards collapses what will the reaction be? Ordinarily, for normal persons, it should be a time for regret, rethinking, and humility ... It would be good if the Democrat / environmentalist true believers learned something from the EV debacle.\"",

The truth, though, is that Antarctica’s ice shelves are actually growing in size.\n\nNew research published by Andreasen et al. looks at Antarctic-wide satellite data collected between 2009 and 2019. The data was compiled using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, or MODIS.\n\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\n\nBetween the 10-year period analyzed, Andreasen et al. discovered that the Antarctic ice shelf area grew in size by 5305 km2. Eighteen ice shelves did retreated in size somewhat during that time, but 16 others grew larger in terms of their overall area mass.\n\n“Our observations show that Antarctic ice shelves gained 661 Gt of ice mass over the past decade,” the researchers noted in their paper.\n\n(Related: When the next “catastrophe” strikes, climate-related or otherwise, Erie County, N.Y., is ready to impose more lockdowns – only “essential workers” with “movement passes” will be allowed to travel.)\n\nNumerous studies confirm: Antarctic ice is doing just fine\n\nAnother study published by Banwell et al. that appears in the journal Geophysical Research Letters looked at an even wider range of Antarctic ice data ranging from 1980 through 2021. That study utilized microwave satellite data from the snow model SNOWPACK.\n\nLike the first study, this second one, which was published in 2023, found that the highest meltwater volumes occurred on Antarctica’s Peninsula, reaching a peak in 1992 and 1993, as well as in 1994 and 1995. SNOWPACK calculated “a small, but significant, decreasing trend in both annual melt days and meltwater production volume over the 41 years.”\n\nAnother paper published by Frazer et al. in the journal Nature backs these findings even further. This one explains that while dramatic ice losses are occurring in some areas of Antarctica, including in West Antarctica from Pine Island and the Thwaites glaciers, ice projections for the future cannot be accurately made.\n\nThis study, which looked at a time period ranging from 2003 through 2015, identified extensive glacial retreat and acceleration along the Bellinghausen Sea coastline. Conversely, things look rather well on the ice front along the Amundsen Sea.\n\n“Our results provide direct observations that the pace, magnitude and extent of ice destabilization around West Antarctica vary by location, with the Amundsen Sea response most sensitive to interdecadal atmosphere-ocean variability,” the authors wrote.\n\nFinally, another paper published by Baico et al., also in 2023, found that over the centuries, Antarctic ice has both thinned and thickened, depending on the time period.\n\nThe authors looked at subglacial bedrock cores to discover that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) between the Thwaites and Pope glaciers “was at least 35 m (meters) thinner than present in the past several thousand years and then subsequently thickened.”",

This, we are told, will \"cool\" down the planet and create a climate utopia.\n\n\"In order to meet this legal commitment, the report states that every citizen of the United Kingdom will need to 'stop using aeroplanes' for a significant period of time,\" reported The Exposé about how the scheme is outlined to work.\n\nIn order to fully comply with the Climate Change Act, airports are not the only thing that has to go. The same report states that the general public will need to stop flying as well as stop doing anything else that creates \"emissions,\" regardless of the energy source.\n\nMeat consumption, for instance, will also need to end because raising cows for beef and sheep for lamb is bad for the environment, the globalists claim. Genetically modified (GMO) soybeans and corn, on the other hand, which have to be doused in deadly chemicals in order to grow, are good for the environment and can stay.\n\nBy 2029, these climate extremists want people in the UK to reduce their meat consumption by 50 percent. The remaining 50 percent will need to be \"phased out\" between 2030 and 2049.\n\nNo more new buildings will be allowed after 2049 either. Pretty much anything that falls into the category of economic activity will need to go, which also means that all people – except for the globalists, of course – will also need to disappear in order to stop them from emitting their very existence and polluting the envisioned globalist utopia.\n\n\"The underlying point is that any asset which uses carbon will have essentially zero value in 2050,\" the report states. \"This in turn may encourage greater use in the run up to 2050 – for example, putting up new buildings at a much faster rate for the next 30 years, knowing that construction must then halt.\"\n\nThe report, by the way, was released in 2019 just prior to covid. In many ways, it serves as a blueprint for what is still to come, which is being catalyzed by the global upheaval that was foisted upon the world in the name of fighting the \"pandemic.\"\n\n\"It is possible that the events of the past two and half years are part of a larger, more sinister agenda that is only just beginning,\" is how The Expose puts it.\n\nMore related news about how stopping climate change and global warming is code for mass depopulation and genocide can be found at Climate.news.\n\nSources for this article include:",

Ukrainian Prime Minister Denis Shmigal claimed he had “no idea” what happened to the funds.\n\nPhilippot also pointed to a recent corruption scandal involving Ukrainian Agriculture Minister Nikolay Solsky, who is accused of illegally appropriating state land worth nearly €6.9 million ($7.4 million). “Yet another case of corruption in this country, which is one of the most corrupt on the planet!” the French politician remarked.\n\n“Every euro sent to Ukraine prolongs the war and therefore causes unnecessary deaths, impoverishes us here, and has a strong chance of enriching the corrupt!” he added, calling for the conflict to be resolved as soon as possible.\n\nUkraine has been plagued by widespread graft for years, and a 2015 Guardian article described it as “the most corrupt nation in Europe.” More recently, it ranked 104 out of 180 countries in Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index.\n\nThe issue has taken center stage during the conflict with Russia, including in the Ukrainian military, which has been rocked by several graft scandals in recent months. This winter, Ukraine’s SBU, the successor to the Soviet-era KGB, announced that it had uncovered a major embezzlement scheme in which Ukrainian officials and private contractors stole around $40 million earmarked for shell procurement.\n\nElsewhere, the Pentagon’s inspector general admitted that Washington had failed to properly track more than $1 billion in weapons sent to Ukraine, although this did not stop US officials from claiming that they believed the assistance to have reached its intended destination.\n\nRussia, meanwhile, has for months been warning about the spillover of foreign weapons sent to Ukraine, cautioning that they are ending up in the hands of organized crime outside of the country.",

Namely, the much-hated carbon tax spiked yet again. These vile virtue-signalers are hellbent on “saving the planet” while they force more Canadians into bankruptcy.\n\nNot that Liberal members of Parliament are fretting over this fiscal kick to the crotch, mind you. Because on that very same day the carbon tax increased, MPs benefited from a 4% pay raise. Must be nice. But if this is some sort of April Fools’ Day joke, we’re still searching for the punchline.\n\nProtests regarding the carbon tax increase erupted across our great dominion last Monday, including one in Uxbridge, Ont., where dozens of farmers assembled outside an arena. Can you blame them? The Grain Farmers of Ontario (GFO) estimate that by 2030, Ontario grain and oilseed farmers alone will pay a staggering $2.7 billion in carbon taxes.\n\nRebel News journalist David Menzies (@TheMenzoid) reports from Uxbridge, Ont. as farmers take to the streets in opposition to the Trudeau Liberals' carbon tax increase.— Rebel News (@RebelNewsOnline) April 4, 2024\n\nOne of the farmers demonstrating in Uxbridge was Ted Eng, 71. He lamented that too many farmers are in a money-losing position now thanks to rising costs and labour rates. And increasing the tax threshold is akin to tossing gasoline on a bonfire.\n\nTed noted that if he were to sell his farm today, it would likely go for about $4 million. He’d be able to pocket the windfall and comfortably retire. But he doesn’t want to. He loves the land. He loves farming. He believes he’s going to die on his farm.\n\nCanadians should be grateful that there are farmers like Ted Eng. Their efforts produce the food that ends up in supermarkets. If farmers are taxed out of existence, then goodbye food security as our meat and potatoes would have to be imported from other nations that have governments that are more farm friendly.\n\nCheck out our interview with Ted Eng, who has much to say about the sorry state of farming these days… not that the Trudeau Liberals give a rodent’s rectum.",

[emphasis, links added]\n\nAmong the groups propped up by the administration is Climate Defiance, a radical environmentalist group comprised of young Marxists who regularly disrupt traffic and shout down U.S. politicians to coerce them into advancing their radical agenda.\n\nAccording to InfluenceWatch, much of the organization’s funding comes from the Climate Emergency Fund (CEF), a nonprofit “that channels money to groups engaged in climate activism.”\n\nCEF has previously received funding from “former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s Onward Together, liberal activist Abigail Disney, and oil heiress Aileen Getty’s Aileen Getty Foundation.”\n\nIn its Saturday release, the White House specifically highlighted Climate Defiance’s Jan. 26 tweet celebrating the administration’s “monumental” decision to ax the aforementioned LNG projects.\n\n“Never thought we would see the day. The White House is amplifying our Twitter account. Words fail. Words fail. Words utterly fail,” Climate Defiance’s X account posted on Sunday.\n\nNever thought we would see the day. The White House is amplifying our Twitter account. Words fail. Words fail. Words utterly fail. pic.twitter.com/G6hFNLofGZ\n\n— Climate Defiance (@ClimateDefiance) January 28, 2024\n\nBeyond funding from Democrat-aligned entities, Climate Defiance is more well-known for its goal of “making life MISERABLE for every person in power” who opts not to endorse its extreme agenda.\n\nEarlier this month, for example, several of the group’s members “swarmed” Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., while he was speaking at a New Hampshire diner.\n\nClimate Defiance agitators chanted “anti-fossil fuels slogans” during Manchin’s remarks. One of them, carrying a sign “calling for the end of fossil fuel dependence,” reportedly jumped in front of the senator’s SUV as it was departing the venue.\n\nThe group claimed Manchin uses his position as chair of the Senate Energy Committee to “protect his personal coal company.”\n\nClimate Defiance’s radical behavior doesn’t stop there.\n\nSince its 2023 launch, the group has attempted to corner several high-ranking Democrats, including President Joe Biden.\n\nAccording to InfluenceWatch, on April 29, its members “created a blockade to prevent elected officials from attending the White House Correspondents’ Dinner at the Washington Hilton, hoping to see [the president] and demand an end to leasing public lands for fossil fuel projects.”\n\nThe organization’s members harassed Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., at a book launch event in May and “blocked traffic and protested outside” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s New York City residence later that same month.\n\nClimate Defiance demonstrators were also reportedly removed from a June event hosted by the Detroit Free Press, at which Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm was scheduled to speak.\n\nAmong the phrases shouted by agitators were, “No MVP. No LNG. Granholm, you are killing me,” and, “F-ck you, Jennifer. F-ck you, Joe Biden. F-ck all these politicians.”",

This is their area of responsibility — this is the outcome of their policy and rule,” Putin said.\n\nAt the same time, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in Davos that the conflict would need to escalate.\n\n\"Moscow has bluffed before with its threats. On the contrary, we need to escalate now because Putin understands only the language of force. If Russia's defeat leads to the collapse of the Putin regime, Europe may become safer and the world — freer and more democratic,\" Zelensky said.\n\nPolish President Andrzej Duda supported Zelensky in Davos:\n\n\"The war will end when we force the Russians out of all the occupied territories. This is obvious to me.\"\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken, answering a question about a truce, noted in Davos that he did not see any conditions for a ceasefire.\n\n\"When you're going through hell, keep going.\"\n\nWinning the conflict is an existential question for all parties. The United States is the main instigator of the conflict with Russia in Ukraine. Today, it is the US that emerges as the main obstacle on the way to a ceasefire and then peace.\n\nIf the US agreed to sign an agreement with Russia, it would be tantamount to stopping NATO's expansion to the east and thus ending the dream of US global domination and exceptionalism. The United States will be clinging to every opportunity to keep and regain geopolitical advantage. Otherwise, the US financial system based on the dominance of the dollar will crumble. That would be lethal to Washington and the US will continue using Ukraine as a bargaining chip in fierce competition with Russia.\n\nThis suggests that hostilities in Ukraine will continue indefinitely until one of the parties is completely crushed and destroyed. Therefore, Russia has no other choice but to force the Kyiv regime to capitulate.\n\nAt the same time, due to internal contradictions in the United States, there is no funding for Kyiv. Ukraine needs $5 billion a month. Without this money, Ukraine is bankrupt, including at the front. Ukraine's manpower has been exhausted, let alone its production potential.\n\nRussia has been developing its defence industry by leaps and bounds lately.\n\nAccording to Stratfor, if there is a ceasefire agreement, it will be concluded on Russia's terms. Maintaining Russia's control over Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions will neutralise Ukraine and prevent its entry into the European Union and NATO in the coming years, Stratfor analysts believe. It is not clear what borders Ukraine presently has. Moreover, Kyiv's formal control over territories does not coincide with reality.\n\nTime will be working for Russia as it continues to develop its defence industry, increase the strength of its army and find ways to circumvent sanctions.\n\nRussia's victory in the conflict in Ukraine would deal a terrible blow to the image of the United States. There is no more \"as long as it takes\" — it has been replaced with \"as long as we can\", Stratfor concludes.\n\nThe outcome of the special military operation in Ukraine will become clear to everyone in four to six months.",

Ukraine’s leaders say revenues from Russia’s energy exports are financing Moscow’s destructive war on Ukraine and must be ended.\n\nThat won’t be easy to do. The EU’s 27 nations get around 40% of their natural gas from Russia and around 25% of their oil. Natural gas would be the most difficult do without, energy analysts say, since most of it comes by pipeline from Russia and supplies of liquefied gas, which can be ordered by ship, are limited amid strong demand worldwide.\n\nGermany, a major manufacturing hub and an importer of Russian gas, has so far resisted an immediate shut-off and said it plans to instead phase out Russian oil by the end of the year and most Russian gas imports by mid-2024. The EU’s executive commission has outlined steps to cut the consumption of Russian gas by two-thirds by year’s end through using more pipeline gas from Norway and Azerbaijan, importing more liqueifed gas, accelerating the deployment of wind and solar projects and intensifying conservation efforts.\n\nGerman Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck said in an interview with the Funke media group that “an immediate gas embargo would endanger social peace in Germany.”\n\nDespite widespread economic sanctions against Russian banks and individuals, the EU continues to send around $850 million a day to Russia for oil and gas, even as EU governments condemn the war in Ukraine. Gas-intensive companies include producers of glass, metals, ceramics and chemicals. Industry officials say in many cases natural gas would be impossible to replace in the short run.\n\nAnalysts say Russian crude oil would be easier to replace than gas but that a boycott would still lead to higher energy prices that would hit consumers who are already facing record EU inflation of 7.5%.",
